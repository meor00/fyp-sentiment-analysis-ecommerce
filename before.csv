""slowing it down"" when the apps are open.and that microsoft store is not it. that's the biggest issue of all. you're pretty confined to the usage of ""apps' that they offer UNLESS you download a whole other program that basically works on top of the microsoft. which is a nuisance and yet another reason to not purchase this.if this is the way of life of computer purchases where you have to download a google app just to put programs on a computer that you'll use. when they USED to work well with and for microsoft years ago... just nope. why should we have to deal with these complications.before it was about making a cell phone like a computer. but now they're trying to make computers like cell phones. and this is one place where it just ain't premium and not working.i hate it. the programs i need and use i can't take advantage of. the stuff i don't want or need are here. they're good for pushing microsoft programs on you. but if you're in this world you know that microsoft doesn't excel at all types of needs involving a computer.  so be aware when you're buying this if you purchase it.also it's so old now that i would say it's not even worth the money they're charging for it. upgrade yourself and get something that will be worth your money.yes they have chromebooks where work from a google mainframe. but they're no better either. because they don't allow you to add on whole programs that you may need either. it's like you can't seem to win these days when buying a computer.just be aware when you're making a purchase. pay attention to the ram. pay attention to the storage space. the number of usb outlets. those do matter. this has three. and i use them all.oh one other thing. last year in 2022 the cord malfunctioned and stopped working to charge it up. so i had to purchase a replacement. which doesn't even fit well. but it does charge it up. so there's that i just have to be mindful if i'm plugged in and the new plug doesn't drop out.so yes it still works. the battery life, not so good roughly a good 2-3 hours of usage out of it, even this many years after the fact. but then i rarely use it without the plug, because i've found that most laptops don't work as well without a plug. and all claim to have a long battery life, until you put them to the test.not being plugged in you don't get full usage of the applications as you'd like. everything slows down. something i don't like. even the web browsers tend to struggle more when it's not plugged in.the sound from the speakers is midrange. not great but not poor. there are things i'd prefer to be louder. but you deal. it's not a touchscreen. but i didn't need it to be one.i paid $343 for this back in 2020. that it's now a few dollars more if it were purchased new today, AND IT'S OLD AND OUTDATED says much to me. this thing needs to be way cheaper given what you get and don't get. it's basically two steps from being obsolete.screen resolution is okay. and to be honest. i bought an acer. cause i've purchased from the name brands that charge more and received a mediocre product. so i figured if i were to get something that was not premium, i didn't want to pay a premium price for it.in the end people are going to spend their money how they choose. so if you want it do it. get it. but i wouldn't.",,,,,,,,"178 people found this helpful","it is what it is.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UAXUXMK8QFAE?ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2023","5705","865","Style: R3 3200U"

The affordable price point was a major selling point, and the laptop has exceeded my expectations in many ways.**Pros:**1. **Affordable Price:** One of the standout features of this laptop is its budget-friendly price. It's a fantastic option for those looking for solid performance without breaking the bank.2. **Sleek Design:** The slim and sleek design of the Acer Aspire 5 is aesthetically pleasing, making it a stylish choice for both work and leisure.3. **Decent Performance:** For everyday tasks and light productivity, this laptop performs admirably. I've been able to multitask, browse the internet, and use various applications without any noticeable lag.4. **Good Battery Life:** The battery life has been impressive, providing ample usage time on a single charge. This makes it convenient for on-the-go use.**Cons:**1. **Limited RAM:** The laptop's 4GB RAM may be a limiting factor for those who require more memory for demanding tasks. Upgrading the RAM would have been a welcome option, but unfortunately, it's not possible.2. **Non-Upgradable GPU:** Another drawback is the inability to upgrade the GPU. While it handles basic graphics tasks well, it might not meet the needs of users with more demanding graphical requirements.In conclusion, the Acer Aspire 5 Slim offers excellent value for its price. It's a reliable option for everyday use, but if you have more intensive computing needs, the limitations in RAM and GPU should be taken into consideration. Despite these drawbacks, I'm overall satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to others looking for a budget-friendly laptop.",,,,,,,,"One person found this helpful","Still holding strong","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2E5ZGT7VSY9WS?ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2023","5705","865","Style: R3 3200U"

This laptop never advertised a touchscreen so there was no misleading information.*** This is a beautiful laptop, easy to use with a big, gorgeous screen. The updates were actually fairly quick, it connected to the internet with no problems. The only real thing I dislike is the fact that I got this laptop for school, and it came with Microsoft preinstalled, but I can't use it. It's been very frustrating trying to open it and get it installed especially since I have a subscription. I can only use the browser version, it's a bit counterproductive for convenience. I've been trying to troubleshoot and install it for over an hour now. On another note, the sound quality is good but the volume is pretty average even on max volume so using headphones would be best. Video is flawless and the browser is great! It holds a decent charge for at least 8 hours and the fan is so quiet, I literally didn't notice it. It's easy to navigate and use and basic user friendly. I say basic because I know there are a lot of people who like to really dig into their electronics and boost and enhance their stuff but I'm not one of those super tech savvy people.

(Opinions on screens and keyboards tend to vary widely - what suits me perfectly may seem to be junk to you, so YMMV).The speakers on the front underside - the sound is O.K. (for an inexpensive laptop) but volume is lacking.Power supplied through a proprietary Acer plug, not through a USB-C port.  Cord can only attach to the laptop on the left side (as seen by the user at the keyboard).Windows ""S"" is installed; it is limited to running apps available only in the Microsoft Store.Suggested upgrade - move up to Windows 10 Home.  It's a free upgrade - with the caveat that you cannot return to ""S"" version.To upgrade to Home version (instructions as of the date of this review; I assume/accept no responsibility if things go awry.  You may want to Google instructions to verify):Go to Settings.Then select Update & Security.In the left sidebar, click Activation.Then click “Go to the Store.”Press the “Get” button under the “Switch out of S Mode” section and in a very short time you'll be assigned the Windows Home version.Suggested upgrade - if you want to encrypt your laptop you may want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise.  These upgrades are not free, check Microsoft for current pricing.The Aspire 5 has a TPM chip so encryption will not require a boot password (not your Windows password).If you want to set a boot password for the computer (not your Windows password) you can set that in BIOS.  Don't forget it - resetting a boot password on a laptop can be a pain and a half (or impossible) to rectify.  See below on how to get into BIOS.The included 128GB PCIe NVMe SSD drive is (for me) large enough to hold Windows 10 Enterprise and the applications I use and is quick enough to run them. I'm in I.T. support (although semi-retired) and don't use the Aspire 5 for computer games. YMMV.Suggested upgrade - add an additional SSD to the computer (screws are in the box, housing and cable required are inside the Aspire 5).  You can Google videos on how to perform the upgrade.  A second internal drive allows you to separate your data from your operating system and applications; if Windows ever has to be completely re-installed your data won't be affected.  If you keep your data in the Cloud you can set the second drive as the sync drive and not fill up “C:” drive.The chip, an AMD Ryzen 3 3200U, does pretty well for my purposes.  Again, gamers may have a different opinion so YMMV. I've had no issues when viewing training or YouTube videos.The battery life won't get me through a typical support day without at least some recharge time - Acer claims up to 7 1/2 hours but, of course, that depends on what you're doing.  Watching videos will eat more power than writing a project proposal in Word.  YMMV, but I bought a second power cord to take with me to client offices while leaving the cord  at my home office plugged in. I seem to be getting 5 hours, maybe a bit better, with the screen set to maximum brightness.The machine doesn't get overly warm in use (again, I'm not a gamer), but I use a laptop board most of the time when the laptop isn't on a hard surface, so there is nearly always some airflow under the machine.The included 4gb of included RAM is really the absolute minimum to think about with Windows 10.Suggested upgrade - add a single 4gb RAM chip in the empty slot (Google for videos on that) to bring the total to 8gb RAM. After installing the additional 4gb the computer will report 8gb installed with ""5.94gb usable"".  The 'missing' RAM is being commandeered by the Radeon software for the display.  If you need/want more the machine can support up to 32gb (1 16gb chip in each slot, discarding the 4gb already installed).  16gb would require 1 8gb chip in each slot, discarding the 4gb already installed.  For business purposes (Office, Chrome and You Tube videos) I'm finding the 8gb (5.94 available) to be acceptable.  YMMV.How 'easy' the RAM and hard drive upgrades are depends on how comfortable you are working with computers.  I found them quite simple.  Be careful not to crack the plastic housing when removing the bottom cover.  Using the correct plastic spudge is helpful, you can search Amazon for a selection of tools. (spudge = type of plastic or rubber pry bar).  Google the ‘how-to’ videos first.""Bloatware"" included with the computer isn't completely over-the-top, but it does take a few minutes to delete all of the junk.  The ""Microsoft Office"" included with the Aspire 5 is a 30-day trial version, not a full license.After uninstalling the bloatware I installed Microsoft Office365 with Access, Adobe Photoshop Elements, DIA (a program for diagramming), AllwaySync (a backup program), Google Chrome, Splashtop Business and Personal (remote access software), VLC Media Player and a couple of network utility applications.  I have 78gb of free space left on ""C"" drive.The three small stickers showing Ryzen chip, Aspire 5 inclusions, and Radeon graphic chip that are stuck onto the hand rest part of the computer can be easily peeled off and leave no residue (I was able to rub the remaining adhesive off easily with my thumb).  I don't know why the stickers are there - presumably if you've bought the machine you know what the details are without seeing sticky notes on the keyboard surface.  If they're for advertising purposes in the store it might be more cost effective to print advertising to be placed by the machine rather than label every machine on the production line.  I also found the ""Full 1080 HD"" sticker on the screen bezel easy to take off.  So I did.  If Acer is interested in putting relevant data on stickers, how about putting the Make, Exact Model Number, Serial Number, and Date of Manufacture on a sticker?  THAT one I would leave in place.  As it is you need to flip the machine upside down to see the manufacturer's information.  (Sorry - this is a pet peeve of mine).A couple of quick notes for those who are new to Windows laptops - if the keyboard fails to light up, check the F8 key - it can toggle the light on/off.  If you suddenly lose your WiFi connection check the F2 key - that toggles ""Airplane Mode"" on/off.  Note that the ""function"" keys are set to use the little icons (F1 is sleep, F9 is mute, etc.).  To use them as traditional function keys you need to hold down the ""Fn"" key simultaneously.  Fn+F9, for instance, will cause the Outlook application to re-sync when you've got that desktop app open.  If you prefer the traditional function key usage (not having to hold down the Fn key to use the keys within applications) you can toggle that in BIOS.  To get into BIOS, reboot the computer and immediately start tapping the F2 key (no Fn key required).For me the 'sweet spot' of laptops is in the 14"" range (11"" for road trips).  That being acknowledged I don't find the extra width or weight of the Aspire 5 to be onerous - the thin screen bezel allows the claim to the 15.6"" screen while not unduly expanding the overall size of the laptop.  At nearly 4 pounds it's a bit heavier than the under-three-pounds-sweetness that I prefer but it's not too bad.  Especially after removing the weight of those ridiculous stickers.  YMMV.If you need more power than this machine has, Acer does offer a similar package with upgrades to the Ryzen 5 chip, 8gb of RAM, and 250gb of hard drive space as well as some other goodies:https://www.amazon.com/Acer-A515-44-R41B-Hexa-Core-Processor-Graphics-dp-B087N4ZRXV/dp/B087N4ZRXV/ref=dp_ob_title_ceHTHRegards,Jim",,,,,,,,"554 people found this helpful","Better with a couple of upgrades but works OK out of the box","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RV1GR3CG72GL1?ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2020","27708","3503","Style: R3 3200U"

Prior to purchasing this laptop, I did a tremendous amount of research so I know how important reviews are, as they helped me make my final decision. In order to help reviewers, I will say up front that I am not a gamer. I am a proofreader/copy editor, spend a lot of time on computers for internet research, including youtube work, and at any given time I have about 7-10 windows open and my computer is THEE primary source/focus of my work. I've had this Acer since mid-August. I waited to write my review in order to see how it performed for a couple of months, as some of the reviews I initially read did the same and I found that to be really helpful.My 12-year-old SONY Vaio ""died"" this summer and I found myself in a position of needing a new laptop but also needing to be really budget conscious due to COVID job constraints. I read over 131 Amazon reviews of this Acer, read two other independent consumer review sites (PC Magazine, Tech World), and asked some tech people in my world what they thought.  This laptop came out in the top three for quality for the price. The price was $359 when I put it in my cart. I waited ONE MORE DAY and that was ONE DAY TOO LONG and by the next day, the laptop was no longer available by Amazon, only from independent Marketplace sellers. I contacted Amazon who could not tell me when/if the Acer would be in stock again. The NEXT day, I read that the Acer would NOT be restocked by Amazon. So I didn't wait and bought it from the Marketplace for $460. Grr.... BUT!!! I am TOALLY PLEASED and happy that I got it when I did. Please note that this Acer IS back on Amazon and you can buy it for less. What a deal.The advice of many reviewers was perfect for my set up. I actually took notes and in the end, set up was incredibly simple and pain-free, and performance has been fantastic. I literally have NO complaints.Based on reviews, I purchased an extra 4G memory stick. ($20) Know what? I still haven't installed it!! I keep forgetting. AND IT HASN'T MADE A DIFFERENCE. To that end, based on reviews, I decided that I would purchase additonal hard drive, but I haven't gotten around to that. Honestly, I may not purchase it at all because I have an external hard drive and I have cloud space. I'm content with knowing that I have the option if I want to purchase more hard drive space if I want. So I have NOT yet had the experience of removing the back of the laptop to install more memory or hard drive. There are plenty of youtube vids that will guide you through the process should you need to do this and I will install the additional memory. Maybe after writing this.Almost no one wants ""S"" mode. There are a few protocols for switching out of ""S"" mode. Here's what I did: I plugged the laptop in, and it began set up. VERY QUICK SET UP. It will automatically be in ""S"" mode: 1. open settings 2. go to ""update & security"" 3. In the ""switch to"" win home or win pro section, select ""go to store."" If you see ""update your edition of windows"" section, do NOT click the ""go to store"" that appears there. 4. Once in the store, you should see a ""switch out of S mode"" or some kind of similar message. Select ""get"". You should get a confirmation message that you've been switched out. SIMPLE and QUICK procedure. I read that some people had trouble with this, but it was a snap for me.List of what I did in total:1. Took out of box, plugged it in. Set up began.2. Got out of ""S"" mode.3. Got rid of a lot of bloatware.4. Downloaded Google Chrome.5. Downloaded Avast Premium Security6. Downloaded Office 3657. Downloaded iTunesEven with all of that, this computer is FAST and as mentioned, I still haven't added additional memory.Powering up/down takes seconds. SECONDS.Navigation is super fast.The computer itself feels solid and I haven't experienced anything with the touchpad that feels chincy or flimsy, as some reviewers noted. . I know what some reviews mean by the bottom corners of the touch pad feeling 'loose'. What it is, is that there are no 'buttons' on the touchpad for ""left or right mouse"" and the lower corners are a tad ""floaty"", as they need to be able to depress independently. I don't use the touchpad a lot, I prefer a desktop mouse, so this doesn't matter to me.The keyboard backlight is great and I've checked with Acer and there's no way to extend the length of time it stays on. It stays on for about 30 secs. This is not an issue for me, as it's on long enough for me to orient myself on the keyboard if it's dark, and then I'm good to go. When typing steadily, the keyboard stays on steadily. Note: one of my cats walked across the keyboard and 'turned off' the backlight. I found that by hitting ""FN + F8"" and holding for 10 secs, you can turn the backlight back on.I LOVE the keyboard. The keyboard feels both solid and smooth. I'm a typist so the ""feel"" of a keyboard and typing is very important to me. My fingers fly over this keyboard! The letters appearing as I type appear to be flowing as words form.The little numeric pad to the right is great. Yes, the keys are a little smaller, so larger fingers may not care for this, but it's great when doing a lot of numeric work. I also love that the ""backspace"" button is larger- not like some keyboards I've had when it's the same size as a letter key.Odd that there's no light showing ""Caps Lock On""- other reviewers have noted this. Nor is there a ""Num Lock"" light, but that doesn't really interfere with my work. It just takes a moment to figure out what's going on if I accidentally leave the Caps Lock on.The power button isn't a hard press button like I've been used to. It's a ""key"", which is interesting.The sound is a big topic on reviews. I've found the sound to be a little low on volume, but it's been ok for youtube vids. Plus, I like using headphones, which make this a non-issue. I've examined the sound settings and done what reviewers have suggested to augment the sound. One reviewer spoke of switching from ""music"" to ""gaming"" mode to increase overall volume, but I haven't even found the setting to do that. No matter, I'm ok with the way it is.The picture/screen is fantastic. Clear and sharp!USB ports-- there are enough for me. I will be purchasing a dvd reader/writer, as this laptop does not have that feature, which makes it lighter and slimmer. In researching dvd drives, I've found highly reviewed ones for around $20. Very reasonable.I have NOT tested battery life yet. I generally keep the laptop in one spot and keep it plugged in. Also, the battery in my SONY Vaio died 2 yrs into owning it and I never replaced it so I'm not even used to moving my laptop around and using a battery. The one time I DID bring this laptop into another room, the battery lasted at least the four hours I had the laptop open.All in all, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this laptop. I've loaded it up and used it CONSTANTLY for two months, haven't installed extra memory yet, and it hasn't given me ONE SECOND of regret or ""hmm"" or concern. It looks great, it's fast, it's light weight, and it can be built up to serve your computer needs. Do NOT worry about ""S"" mode, that's an easy thing to let go of. I have no doubt this laptop will last me years and will serve my needs admirably. If anything else comes up as I continue to use it, I'll be sure to update my review! Despite paying more than what Amazon is currently selling it for, it was STILL a deal. I literally have no complaints at all. I recommend registering it and keeping note of Acer's toll free number in case you need support.Good luck and enjoy! It's a great purchase!UPDATE: It's nearly one year since I've been using this Acer laptop and I STILL love it. It has not given me one second of issue or regret. I ended up installing my additional memory after I posted my review but I haven't purchased additional hard drive. I've loaded a LOT more software and apps and it's still fast, crisp and spot on.

Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XURpeSD+L._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,"4,370 people found this helpful","This is NOT a Budget Laptop!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MPTX8KAGSWG1?ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2019","27708","3503","Style: R3 3200U"

I can't really write a review of the computer out of the box because before I ever turned it on, I installed a 2nd RAM card, then when I booted it, I signed into my account which changed it from Windows 10 S mode to Windows 10 Pro since I have several Windows 10 Pro product keys associated with my account.With that being said, this computer outperforms what it is meant to do. Is this going to be the strongest computer you can buy? No, not at all. However, this computer has edited large videos for me in minutes, I can use my music notation software on it with no lag or freezing (Sibelius), and it does actually process games at the higher resolutions. I've tested games as demanding as Forza Horizon 4 and it, surprisingly, performs with no issues. It does run hotter, of course, but not exactly ""hot"". Heavier usage draws down the battery, but that can be said for literally any electronic device.I purchased this to replace my well-aged HP G60 whatever model that was that I purchased 12 years ago and just kept updating. Up until around July 2020, it was still up to specs to work from home, something I actually bought that computer for 12 years ago. Finally, an update to most of the work at home platforms finally rendered that old beast useless. Ironically, I used the stimulus check from back then (2008) to purchase that computer. With that laptop in mind, I premium laptop to me is one that I can upgrade and repair easily. The HP G60 line did that quite well. Now here in 2020, I purchased one of these for someone else at first. During setup, I noticed the slot to add another SSD, I added the second RAM chip for that one as well since I already knew about that, but I also noticed how easy it was to work on it. We booted it up, put a Windows 10 Pro key on it as well, and from the start, I was impressed with the performance. I was so impressed that I bought myself one.This thing is super lightweight. The keyboard does have slight smaller keys which takes all of about 20 seconds to get used to. This is because it fit a full number pad on the right of the main keyboard, something that is a must for me with a laptop. One thing I absolutely don't find at this price range is the backlit keyboard.Spoiler alert: with the backlight turned on for the keyboard, your battery time can be reduced by as much as 50%. You really don't need it if you're used to typing on pretty much any keyboard, but it's nice when you do need it at night in the middle of a shift. The button to turn it on and off is located pretty much at the center of the top row (F keys). Just to the left of that is the button to turn off the track pad. Very nice placement on both of those.The graphics seems to use a combination of resources that gives you 5 GB reserved just for graphics processing. Not bad at all. This must be what pushes it to be able to do a lot more than expected for this price.It's nice going into the Microsoft Store to check the system requirements on games (Halo series, Forza Horizon, etc) and not see any red indicating the computer doesn't meet the requirements.For working from home, this is excellent for those resources that might require a proprietary desktop that you have to load and run via USB. It also has a built in ethernet port, which is usually required for those particular work from home platforms, but it also performs flawlessly on the 5 GHz wifi networks for the rest.As a digital nomad, I also have to upload and edit and create videos. This thing surprisingly gets through Adobe and other applications with ease and renders videos quite fast.This was supposed to be a quick purchase for me to replace my aged out HP and then I'd get another good laptop later on, but I'm probably just going to buy a couple more of these.*Update*I've noticed two things that improved performance. First, I downloaded the full AMD Radeon Software (it comes with the ""lite"" version) and that opened up a lot of performance tweaks on both the cpu and gpu.Also, I'm noticing the battery time listed must be an overall average. When I'm just browsing, watching a few Youtube videos in the browser, and doing stuff like writing product reviews, with the brightness turned down to the lowest setting and with the backlit keyboard off, I seem to get between 9 and 10 hours of battery life from a full charge. Not sure if that's normal for this device, but it's what I keep noticing. Make sure you also turn off bluetooth and location and all that other stuff you're likely not using because those can draw the battery down quickly. When I have the brightness up, keyboard lights on, playing games with the Xbox controller connected via bluetooth, working (headset in, running work platform software), the battery time can be as low as 5 hours from a full charge.I don't allow any sleep or hibernate functions. Those tend to kill a hard drive. There's nothing I'm ever doing that can't just be saved so I can properly shut the computer down. Sleep and hibernate modes can also do some strange things to batteries, usually causing software glitches that can wreck even the best batteries. They can also cause data fragmentation... all in all, I just don't use those functions on any computer, and for all I know, it could contribute to the better luck I have with laptop batteries and having never had hard drive failure.",,,,,,,,"116 people found this helpful","Easily 5 stars for the range of laptops it's supposed to be in. * Update, still 5 stars. *","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30U153MVWDKSV?ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2020","27708","3503","Style: R3 3200U"

It's plenty fast enough for normal use, I find 14"" to be great for portability, the screen is nice and bright, the trackpad works great, they keyboard has a sensible layout and feels nice, there's pretty good port selection, and the overall look-and-feel are great.

I've also had good success remote streaming games from my primary system with it.I think the main thing here is to keep speed expectations in check - if you're a heavy PC user and looking for a primary computer, you may find the specs limiting here. It's very responsive under normal load, but it won't handle gaming or anything heavily performance-bound. The 8 GB of RAM might at some point be a limiting factor, but today it's plenty for normal usage. As a secondary PC or a primary for someone who's not doing much beyond the basics, I think it's plenty fast enough.The laptop is affordable but to me doesn't feel ""cheap"". Sure it's plastic construction, but it's very well laid-out.

The Toshiba one was starting to show its age by failing to pass POST and thus failing to boot. I had used it almost every single day since 2012 after all, as it was my college laptop and even helped me launch my career as an engineer, so it has served me well. But the OS failures were getting troublesome. They were happening increasingly often, so I decided before all my data was lost (which wasn't really that much, since I keep all my actually important data on a home file server), I decided to shop around for a nice, reliable, not-too-cheap laptop I could use to replace it, and this is the one I chose to buy.For the non-Linux enthusiasts, feel free to skip this paragraph, but a kernel panic is basically the Windows blue screen of death equivalent on Linux. My old Toshiba was having kernel panics all the time starting with Kernel 5, so I thought maybe it was my old hardware which has having trouble with the brand new kernel. I tried an LTS version of Kernel 4.19, thinking it was going to solve my kernel panic issue, but nope. I still had kernel panics all the time, and it was starting to get worrying how often it was happening (multiple times a day near the time I got this new Acer laptop). So I feel like I got the new Acer laptop just in time before the Toshiba hardware became unbootable. Now, I'm an electrical engineer, but I'm a lazy engineer. I didn't feel like dissecting the Toshiba to try and pinpoint what the problem might have been. I use Arch btw (best meme 2k19)So back to regular English. I'm thoroughly impressed with the hardware that AMD has developed with their Ryzen lineup and their Vega graphics. Sadly, with all the cryptocurrency mining happening nowadays, it's actually hard to find any AMD graphics card for use with actual graphics workloads like gaming. But that's beside the point. This Acer laptop, with its Ryzen 3 processor and built-in Vega Picasso graphics is almost overkill for what I use it for. I haven't tested any games on it, but I imagine it would run Minecraft well enough. Maybe not 60fps, but still enough to play. I use this laptop mainly for just web browsing, and occasional coding when I'm feeling ambitious with some sort of personal software project I want to work on.In the time that I used Windows 10 S Mode... it was just plain dumb. Not being able to install software from non-Microsoft sources? Really, Microsoft? What are you doing? You can easily opt out of the S Mode crap, but it warns you that you'll never be able to go back to S Mode in the future if you ever change your mind. Like that'll scare me into keeping S Mode! I'll show you how much I care about S Mode. I only spent about a half hour tinkering with it before I just blasted the whole NVMe M.2 drive clean and installed good old Arch Linux on it with a fully encrypted filesystem, so ain't nobody getting into my data. And I can say, this NVMe M.2 drive is freaking lightning quick. Compared to the old HDD on my Toshiba, this new laptop boots in like 15 seconds, if even that. My main PC with Godly specs (Intel i9-9900K + RTX2080Super + 1TB Samsung NVMe M.2) boots in around 10 seconds, so this little laptop is definitely keeping up with the speed.Overall, this Acer laptop is a fantastic computer; probably the best laptop I've ever owned at this price point. It's perfect for basic usage, and I recommend it to be used for light workloads like checking email, browsing social media, editing office documents, coding, and other basic tasks of the sort. The Ryzen + Vega chip will definitely last several years, and I'm happy to finally support a quality AMD product. Ultimately, it's up to you as the customer to decide if this is the right computer for your needs. Evaluate why you need this computer and determine whether or not the price of this laptop would best suit your needs. I needed something I could rely on with streaming, decoding, and rendering video data from YouTube, Twitch, and/or Netflix which is actually a bigger task than people give it credit for. If you don't intend to watch many videos or do anything more resource-intensive than that, then this laptop might be a touch too powerful for your needs. With all that in mind, it's safe for me to say that this Acer laptop is perfect for the moderately light workloads I intend to use it for.",,,,,,,,"4 people found this helpful","Perfect computer for light workloads.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32R8CGXMR7MCT?ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2019","27708","3503","Style: R3 3200U"

I first did research for my wife. She likes to move her laptop to various chairs around the house. Once online, connected to the world through WiFi, she looks up news and other things, checks her email, does banking, and watches a few videos. Sometimes we talk to family and friends on Skype. I know a lot more about computers than she does, so she asked me to find one for her. A touch-screen wasn't important, so I was looking for a thin, attractive, high-resolution screen laptop, with reasonable speed and a solid operating system. We've also tried tablets , but without a decent physical keyboard, found them lacking. The bonus was, judging by her needs, I didn't think we needed to break the bank to find a decent machine at the lower end of the scale. When we bought it, just a month ago at the time of this writing, the price was a hair under $350. Today, a quick review of the product page shows they've shoved that up by $70 to $420. Why?? I have to say, that might have been a deal-breaker.However, I did choose this Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop. It arrived and I went to work to set it up for her. It was pretty intuitive. Plug it in, press the power button, and follow the prompts. Easy. However, we like to use a lot of apps not made (or even approved) by Microsoft. The laptop comes with Windows 10 on it, in Microsoft's ""S"" mode. In other words, they set it up so you can only get Microsoft programs and apps that come from their online store. If that doesn't suit you, don't despair: you can opt out of that ""Microsoft-only"" mode during setup.For example, we like using the Opera browser, not M's ""Edge."" As soon as you try and download the program, Microsoft pop ups appear, all concerned: ""are you sure?"" ""Apps not approved by Microsoft may be dangerous -- may damage your computer."" And ""once you abandon S mode, you will not be able to get it back!"" Don't worry, go ahead and press the button. You'll still have Windows 10 and can choose apps from wherever you want them.I'm not going to go through the technical stuff in this review. You can read all about that on this product page. I'll just tell you, the laptop is attractive, light and thin, the screen is big enough for everything you want to do, including watching videos and movies, and it is in good resolution. It runs quietly, and its interface with WiFi and online webpages is good. The backlit keyboard is nicely laid out and easy to type on. You get 3 x USB ports, plus others. You get 4 gigs of working RAM, which may not sound like a lot, but it's plenty to handle watching videos etc. You get 128 gigs of memory on the harddrive -- again, not huge, but it is solid state, which means, dependable. And these days, it's so easy to add an external drive or get yourself a bunch of thumb drives which are now cheap - cheap - cheap. And of course, you can use Microsoft's One Drive (installed) or any other cloud memory service you prefer.My wife is happy with her Acer. And then, a couple of weeks after we got hers, my own laptop went down for the final count. I happen to do advanced video and photograph editing on two different desktops, a PC and a Mac for various applications. But I also like to use a laptop for much of the same things my wife does. My choice was even easier this time. I chose the same Acer we'd just acquired for her.

Upon looking at the CPU specs on AMD's website, the CPU base clock is 2.8 GHz and the max boost clock is 4.3 GHz. the real question is under what conditions you can use that upper range beyond 2.8. Maybe some settings in BIOS, an AMD performance management software, or maybe it's automatically managed?  Not sure, but I will have to investigate it further.

I'm a computer repair technician and I bought the base model (Ryzen 3 w/4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD).  As a technician (meaning someone who can upgrade and repair computers), I'd give this a 3.5/5.  As an end user however, I really don't know who this is supposed to be made for.  It's woefully underpowered and comes with a crippled OS.  If you don't mind those things then there are a lot of cheaper options.  If you DO mind those things then I hope you know what you're doing because it's going to take a LOT of time and effort to get this thing usable.First off, S mode.  It's basically a Chromebook in S mode.  Again, you can get a Chromebook (or even another S mode device) for much cheaper than this so I don't know why you'd choose this one.  Putting that aside however, most people say that you can just get out of S mode and you'll have a normal computer, right?  Well, in THEORY that's true.  In practice however, Windows 10S likes to randomly and inexplicably revert to S mode without warning.  As a technician I see these S mode computers all the time that have reverted back to S mode with no way to go back to Windows 10 Home except to do a complete wipe and reload of the OS.  If you want to PERMANENTLY get out of S Mode, you have to get out of S mode, then download a copy of Windows 10 from the Microsoft website and make a USB flash drive with Windows 10.  Then you have to open up the flash drive, go into the Sources folder and add an ei.cfg file with the following parameters:[EditionID]Home[Channel]RetailOnce you do that you can boot from the flash drive, erase the drive, and install Windows 10 Home from scratch.  If you don't add the ei.cfg file it will just reinstall Windows 10S again.  This is not something a normal end user would be able to do, but it's necessary if you want to be able to feel secure that the thing isn't going to just randomly revert back to S mode and become unusable.Secondly, the specs.  4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD?  Seriously, Acer?  The last time 4GB of RAM was standard on laptops was like 2012.  I could see if this were a $150 computer, but at $366 it should have at LEAST 8GB of RAM and a 250GB SSD.  I upgraded mine to 8GB of RAM, a 500GB NVMe SSD, and a 2TB 2.5"" hard drive.  It's been close to a decade since I've personally owned a computer with a hard drive but it's nice to have that ability.  I also appreciate the fact that they include the mounting hardware and even the screws in a separate bag.Third, the screen.  The screen is okay, but there's a major flaw that took me a while to figure out.  The screen will dim if you unplug the charger and run it on battery.  That's normal, right?  Well what's NOT normal is that AMD has a setting called ""Vari-Bright.""  If this is turned on and you unplug the computer, the display doesn't just dim but it also loses contrast/color.  It's hard to describe it but it looks like crap.  Unfortunately the AMD Radeon software doesn't get installed through Windows Update and it's not on Acer's website so you have to go directly to AMD in order to download it.  Unfortunately that also means that AMD is going to install the latest drivers on your device, which haven't been tested and certified compatible by Acer.  Chances are it will be fine, but it's always best to use the latest driver from the computer manufacturer (in this case, Acer) rather than going to the chip manufacturer.  There are a million and one potential compatibility problems with new drivers, which is why they need to be tested by the manufacturer, who may update other drivers to compensate.  This isn't possible if you want to turn off ""Vari-Bright"" because you're forced to install the latest drivers from AMD.The next problem is with the keyboard backlight.  It turns off after 30 seconds and it won't turn back on again if you move the mouse.  You MUST touch a key on the keyboard to turn it on again.  There's a setting in the BIOS to disable the keyboard backlight timeout, but it doesn't have any effect.  Speaking of which, this computer shipped with an older BIOS revision (1.10).  I upgraded to the latest BIOS revision (1.11) but it didn't fix the keyboard backlight timeout problem.  Looking online it seems that a LOT of people are having this problem and not only with this model of Acer.  Apparently, Acer doesn't care about this problem.  I almost want to return it for this reason, but I really need another computer so I guess I'll keep it.  If I hadn't been able to resolve the screen brightness problem this would have been going back.The final issue is the battery life.  If all you're doing is reading articles this MIGHT be able to get you 4 hours of battery life.  If you're watching videos or you have a lot of stuff open, you'll be lucky to get 2-3 hours.  I mean, all manufactures overestimate their battery life to make their products look good, but this laptop doesn't last much longer than my 10 year old HP.In conclusion, I stand by my initial statement.  I truly don't know who this computer is for.  If you add the cost of the base computer ($366), plus the 500GB SSD ($60), the RAM ($45), and the 2TB hard drive ($80), you're left with a total cost of $551, and there are a lot better computers out there at that price point.  There's an 11th gen i5 15"" HP laptop on here for $599 with over TWICE the processing power, a 250GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM.  It also has space for a secondary hard drive if you need to upgrade that in the future.  If you're okay with an underpowered laptop (4GB RAM, small SSD) with a crippled OS (Windows 10S) you can get one for $150 and save yourself $200.I mean, I wouldn't call this thing a ""nice"" laptop.  It only has a single USB 3 port (the other two, including the one on the RIGHT side are USB 2.0 - that's right, a technology that debut in April of 2000 which means it's even older than Windows XP!).  It feels cheap/flimsy.  Battery life is mediocre.  It's basically a disposable laptop at a non-disposable price.  If this laptop was $150 - $200 I wouldn't be so critical of it, but whether you're looking for a cheap Chromebook type laptop or you want a real laptop that you can upgrade yourself, you can do so much better by going with something else.  I'm only keeping it because I've put so much time and effort into it and it's easier than returning it and starting over.The only person I can see that this would be suited for would be someone with a very limited budget that wants to be able to upgrade it over time vs. spending the $550 upfront.  But if they knew how to do all this computer stuff, chances are they'd have a better income and therefore a higher budget.  Maybe a student or someone just entering the workforce?  I dunno.I must say though, I'm really liking having a secondary drive in a laptop again.  It helps if I need to wipe it out because I don't have to worry about backing up the data since it's on the second hard drive.  But again, there are other computers with this capability.  If you can afford it, the $599 HP with the 11th gen i5 is a great buy.  I haven't personally purchased that computer but after doing all this, I wish I had.",,,,,,,,"153 people found this helpful","I really don't know who this is supposed to be made for","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVIKFNTNS9RAD?ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2021","1483","891","Style: R3 3200U"

No CD-ROM/DVD-ROM. I have no idea how I missed this. I went to install my printer software and realized there is no drive to do this. I thought it was so common-place that I never even considered a laptop being sold without one. How very bizarre. This means no DVD burning capabilities, no installing a game disc, nothing. Wow. Now maybe I'm old-fashioned since many things are done digitally now, but geez. My bad on not paying attention to the product description. I always back up my photography to disc, ALWAYS. nope, can't with this laptop. Fixed by spending $50 more to buy a used external drive.2. Why do modern laptops use one single mousepad for right-click, left-click, and moving the cursor? I can't tell you how frustrating that was. I can only use this laptop with an outside USB mouse, otherwise, I would be pulling my hair out every time I touch the thing. I attempted to adjust the sensitivity but with no way of feeling a right or left click, you end up clicking somewhere in the middle half the time.3. The sound on this thing is terrible. I had to buy a USB speaker so I can even hear some stuff. Speakers on the bottom of the laptop, wow. You can cup the sound to try to hear what you are listening to. What a joke. Speakers I bought were also crap so spent at least $40 trying to get audible sound for this laptop.I would rather a laptop be slightly bulkier for better features. I feel that I downgraded from my previous laptop that is at least 5 years older. My last laptop had a larger screen, a mousepad that had separate buttons for right and left click, sound I could hear, AND a DVD-ROM. Wow.Why I gave it two stars? The processing speed is ok. Still, it is no better or worse than any other new computer or laptop I have ever bought, it is just less bogged down with junk when it is new. I almost thought about returning it numerous times, but it sucks to have to delete everything and start fresh again on a new system. I also think there is a restocking fee since it isn't technically broken. Too bad because I would pay more for a system that was more functional. Since I bought the speaker and have the mouse, at least I fixed two of the issues on my own.Hell no to playing video games. I tried playing Cloudpunk on Steam and it lagged so bad I gave up. Sure, you can play games, just not higher quality ones.Lastly because I just can't stop. Why does my backspace key make a weird high-pitched sound? Weird. I do NOT recommend this product and would not buy it again.Edit: Now my ""L"" key isn't functioning properly and I have to hit it harder or twice to get it to work. This is by far the cheapest laptop I have ever owned, and I'm very disappointed with it. Saving money did NOT work out this time. I am still a student so use my laptop quite frequently. This will surely agitate and slow me down and now I'm wishing I had paid more for a better laptop. It hasn't even been a year of ownership.. BUYER BEWARE!Second edit: less than two years after purchase.. I didn’t expect to need to update this again, but now my battery is dead and it barely held a charge for most of its life. I knocked it down to one star. I have an older laptop that still holds charge and the battery still works. The quality of this product is very poor. Still one of my biggest regrets since laptops are extremely useful for school and I’m not finished yet. Do I buy a new battery and suck it up? This laptop will cost $500+ by the time I’m done buying new parts, and still will have issues. I sure wish companies would build quality products made to last… made to last at least 5 years.",,,,,,,,"20 people found this helpful","Well that was a disappointment","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RNB5DFUYWONH?ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2020","1483","891","Style: R3 3200U"

I purchased in March 2020 to prepare for working remotely.  Everything was fine- it all worked as it should.  Now the built-in camera has stopped functioning properly.  It looks like it is working but there is only a black screen in the image window- for both camera and video.  On zoom calls, it looks like the video is working but there is nothing but a black screen. Open up the camera using the camera app- same thing.  Updating driver shows that the current driver is installed.  Resetting the app does nothing. Resetting privacy settings does nothing. Troubleshooting does nothing- all diagnostics indicate that everything is ""working properly"", no issues. One day it worked fine.  The next day it did not.  Searches on both the Acer community forum on their website and google in general show multiple users all reporting the same exact problem- and following all of the same steps, with absolutely no resolution. Chatting with Acer technical support- the best they can offer is ""try a factory reset"" and if that doesn't work, send it in for repair.  Which of course is impossible because the laptop is now my office for work since my company is still working remotely for the foreseeable future. So in order to send this one in to be repaired, I would need to buy a new one anyway in order to keep my job.  I've had multiple laptops over the years- HP, Asus, samsung-  all worked for years.  This is the first (and hopefully only time) that I've had one stop functioning in less than 4 months after purchase- with no viable resolution offered by the company.**EDIT-  Factory Reset fixed nothing and just made re-setting up everything that was removed a pain in the butt.  Camera is still non-functional.  Acer tech support and customer support useless.  No solution offered other than sending the laptop that I rely on every day in for repair- despite the fact that you can easily google and find the same issue reported by multiple users going back to at least 2018.  Support rep that I spoke to the second time claimed that on their system, they don't show that there are any reported issues with the Aspire 5.  SMH. Worst customer service ever.  And I'll never purchase Acer again.If I could make the rating no stars, I would . Not only did the build-in camera stop working with no apparent solution, a plug & play webcam won't work either.  Uninstall the built-in webcam and it aumotically reinstalls itself.  The P&P webcam works fine on a $200 5 yr old laptop that my 8 yr old has tortured- but won't work on this 9 month old laptop.  Whatever is causing the problem with the built-in camera (that Acer claims isn't a recognized or persistent problem on its machines despite pages of forum posts )  prevents any other camera from working as well.Edit #2-  finally gave up in the constant fiddling necessary to use this laptop. Plug & play camera I bought when the built in camera stopped functioning only works part of the time because the laptop won't recognize its plugged in.  Wifi drops without any cause (only happens on the laptop). Speaker quality has degraded to the point where I have to use headphones or a speaker to hear anything. External areas of the laptop are coming apart. Two weeks ago it wouldn't boot up- then it did and seemed fine. A few days later, opening anything took forever- browser windows, internal functions, couldn't get the shutdown menu to pop up.  Happened again two days ago. I gave up and drove to best buy to buy a lenovo. Within 15 minutes of turning on the new laptop, I realized just how terrible the Acer has overall functioned from day one.  I don't need high-end functionality- not a gamer, not a graphic designer, not running a business. I've had a number of computers from desktop to laptop that have lasted for years. This Acer was barely functional for web browsing and email.  Forget using it to stream any shows/movies/music.",,,,,,,,"9 people found this helpful","Camera stopped functioning in less than 3 months.

However, due to terrible support and shady practices, it's been wildly cheapened by Acer.1. Acer installed their own adware on my device without my knowledge or consent.  Worse, they created unchangeable notification settings, buried the installation files in a hidden directory, abused the character limit to hide it from the program removal tool; either hid it from the registry with deceptive location and naming, or used a scheduled executable and won't provide the information necessary to determine whether simply deleting the files is safe.2. People who have deleted the files are reporting either a failure to completely remove [meaning the files bounced back] or breaks caused by the removal of the files.  These breaks include loss of data, boot looping, massive decrease in system performance, and registry errors.3. Acer has provided no tool for removing their bloatware.  One must blindly trust a third party tool for the ""safe"" removal of the software.4. The tech support doesn't know how to remove the software, instead redirecting me to other resources that either don't address this specific issue directly or don't provide a solution.  Windows cannot detect and remove software that has a name longer than 60 characters in the registry.  The removal must be performed through the registry.  Because the identify of these files in the registry is not published, it would take hours - days to find and remove the software via the registry.  This method could result in the aforementioned breaks, especially if done incorrectly.  For example, an accidental removal of a vital system file could occur.5. After waiting well over half an hour in their support queue, being as how I got in before they closed for business, the support team left for the day while I was STILL waiting for support.  The chat support agent doesn't open after hours.  I have a screenshot of the agent being open, meaning I made it in time for support.  They simply didn't care and left anyway.I bought this machine for work and have to deal with interruptions because of this adware.  I haven't owned this device for even two whole months yet.  This wasn't an issue until this week, when the adware went active.  During some automatic system update, this was enabled.  After the last automatic system update from last month (March 25, 2020), I took advantage of my Windows Pro privileges, looked up the proper way to disable automatic system updates, and then promptly did so [this cannot be done through normal Windows system settings without setting up a metered connection, which I'm unable to do because I telecommute for work and it would interfere with the systems in place with my employer].The hardware is EXCELLENT for the price, however, the experience with Acer is a NIGHTMARE.  I won't suggest missing this device.  Buy it, buy and install Windows 10 Pro, find out how to turn off automatic system updates via the Group Policy Editor, disable automatic updates there and in system settings [to be safe] AS SOON AS it this laptop boots for the first time, buy and install your [secondary] 2.5 inch SSD / HDD / hybrid drive, and buy and install your RAM upgrades [up to 32 GB supported].  If you do that, you'll have a wonderful experience with this device.  If you make the mistake of trusting Acer not to compromise your system through updates after you purchase, you'll have a pretty bad experience trying to fix what they sneakily do to it.  Once you're loaded with dozens of GB of data, it's not nearly so easy to just start over.This rating is justified by this company policy.  The company did this to my laptop.

I really needed a new laptop soon for some important conferences coming up in the next few days.  With Prime, it still took three days for this to arrive.  As soon as it was dropped off, I unpacked it and plugged it in.  The very first thing I noticed was how loose and flimsy the power cord connector is. When it’s plugged into the laptop, it’s very loose, it still has about 1/8 to 1/4” freeplay back and forth and in and out. It doesn’t click in tightly.

I was not expecting to run into so many problems right when I took this out of the box.1. Immediately I heard something loose inside the laptop that was rolling around when I pulled it out of its packaging.2. The sound is so bad it's like buying a pair of earbuds in the the dollar store. The speakers are also under the laptop which makes it worse for the sound quality.3. Loud fan when it gets a little warm when using.4. Scratching sound quality when using multiple tabs. I had about 5 tabs open and while watching youtube videos I noticed the sound would cut out or make scratching noises when it is trying to process all the programs.5. Customer service from both Acer and Amazon makes it difficult to fix your/my issues. I contacted customer service the same day after I received this laptop and also the day after. After telling them all of my issues they suggested to send it to Acer but it will take around 20 business days to have everything fixed.6. Possible restocking fee. Wanting to return this item, even though I barely used it the first 2 days, customer service told me that I cannot send any pictures or videos of the laptop and they would have to inspect it BEFORE they can tell me whether or not I will be charged a restocking fee. If you don't like being surprised by restocking fees, don't buy this laptop so you won't have to return.7, I was recommended to use a separate speaker to fix the audio problem (basically to spend more money just so I can hear sounds without it sounding like a broken audio file.8. Screen quality is definitely not good. I would give it a 6/10. The color difference when using a decent another laptop or monitor, the difference is super noticeable.9. 4gb of ram will not be enough trust me. You would have to buy another ram if you want this to run better and you're basically forking more money just to make this laptop a little bit more usable.I know this has good reviews but don't be fooled by it. I was swayed when I was going through the reviews but after I got my product, I was highly disappointed. I wish I had spent more money to get a more reliable laptop.

First off, the build quality is really solid and premium feeling. They keyboard is just right. The backlights are a nice bonus.  I wish the keyboard layout was a bit different with larger arrow keys but that is just a minor thing. The screen is really gorgeous, with large viewing angles and really black blacks. Battery life seems pretty good. One thing that surprised me on this laptop was the graphics. I wasn't expecting much but I installed Counterstrike Source and did a quick test and it gets over 100fps in 1080p. I did not try any new games but just the fact it can play even older 3d games alone is a nice bonus to me. I've ordered the 4gb extra ddr to get a performance boost, that should be the first thing done to this laptop, after turning off windows S mode and uninstalling bloatware. I installed an old 250gb SSD into the empty bay. Wow that ""cable"" is tiny and thin but it works.  Also they don't provide tiny screws to mount that SSD,so I just ended up taping mine in..but it worked fine. You will quickly run out of storage if you do not add another sata SSD or replace the NVMe ssd.Speakers do kind of suck. Volume is too low. I almost feel as though I could probably upgrade them myself if I really wanted to, though haven't tried yet.For whatever reason, as someone else pointed out, the function keys are enabled by default, and not the standard F1-F12 functions. Really stupid is F1 is mapped to ""sleep"" so if you accidentally hit F1 when trying to hit ESC, your laptop shuts down...extremely annoying! I disabled that in software in Windows settings. But I will try to update the BIOS as well. Also if you use this on your lap (imagine that) or your chest while in bed for any length of time, it will get hot. To avoid this, I purchased a laptop cooler which is just basically a plastic tray that allows air to vent through the sides.PC does boot up very fast though.Also as other posters have pointed out, you actually CAN use this laptop for gaming for the latest games, if you use Steam streaming and have a gaming desktop pc. That feature works incredibly well, and I've been able to play some of the newest games on this thing using streaming.So overall still happy with the laptop after a month of use.

Same sleek design, very good screen, same materials and build quality, and all the latest tech inside along with Windows 10 Home once you switch out of S Mode.If your laptop is four or five years old like my old one you're in for a treat. Everything about this one is better than my old. It's lighter, quieter, sleeker, runs cooler, and the screen is leaps and bounds better. The keyboard feels quality, back lit, and you won't disturb anyone while typing as its very quiet in use. No more clacking!Cons? The screen could get 20% brighter. The volume could be louder from the speakers and varies in loudness from app to app at 100%. No optical drive if you're used to having one, but inexpensive external drives are easily found. No finger print reader or USB-C port as found on the more expensive models of this unit. But as said if you want or need more, pay more.Thanks to the AMD graphics you can do light to moderate gaming with this if you upgrade the RAM to at least 8gb. Quick, easy, and cheap to do. You'll need to adjust settings down, also. Sometimes dramatically. But you can play some games. Less demanding and older ones with no trouble, and on higher settings.I would recommend upgrading RAM to 8gb or more, and storage as well if need be. This isn't a matter of shortcomings with the unit, just a matter of you get what you pay for out of the box. Which is enough for a lot of us. Heck if you use your computer like many to browse the web, social media, stream videos, store photos, online shopping, modest multi tasking, and for school, work, and organization, you may not upgrade at all. I've been using it out of the box for those purposes for three days and have no slowdowns, hiccups, or crashes. It just operates smoothly, quietly, speedily, and looks good doing it. Oh, and boot up time is non existent. This thing is up and running as fast as my phones.I got mine on Cyber Monday and saved $30. But had I paid more I'd be just as happy. If in the market for a sleek and stylish BASIC laptop that doesn't look or feel like a budget unit and with all the modern hardware and software inside, you can do worse. But certainly no better.",,,,,,,,"One person found this helpful","Excellent!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BYZL8HTU5IZ1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019","27708","3503","Style: R3 3200U"

I was going cancel and buy it again but decided with the way that laptop was designed it would be a future problem I did not want to deal with it also only had one RAM slot, so I rolled the dice and bought this again. If it fails in one or two years I can at least say hey I didn't lose much and can salvage the parts.  If you use Windows nowadays it has to have 8GB this coming with 4GB was not acceptable but I know how to do basic upgrades. This came with  2 memory slots if the cheapo wifi card fails I will buy a small external one in 6 months since I no longer trust the wifi chip. If your laptop dies within the 30 day period do not screw around return it ASAP.I put in a 16gb memory stick in the second slot, and a 512 GB  SATA SSD for additional storage.  I also bought a USB fingerprint reader that I put in a 2.0 usb slot.  If the product works right out of the box for a few days then from my previous experience the laptop will work fine until you mess it up in a few years in which case I will salvage the parts and throw the piece of crap by that time away. If it still works then it will be installed with a flavor of Linux that I will then put in.I had an old 11 inch quad 900mhz processor upgraded to 10GB RAM and it works fine with Linux but Windows not so much so I am sticking with this laptop for media consumption until it is so far gone that I need to put Linux on it.Also like me please keep your expectations low so you will not get disappointed.

The frame is very study with little to no flex.Upgrade the RAM!Get at least a second 4gb stick of RAM to benefit from duel channel bandwidth.This translated into about 2x the fps in gaming.Although this is a productivity, you can run games surprisingly well on it!I was able to get 60fps on many different games, gta5 will see 35-45fps on low settings, killing floor 2 saw 50-60fps on low settings, paladins saw a pretty consistent 60fps 1080p low / medium settings, Warframe saw 40-50fps with the right combination of gfx settings.I edited and rendered this video using this machine and it was a great experience.The IPS display looks great but could stand to get a little brighter. Using it indoors should be fine and at night I find it to be plenty bright and end up lowering the brightness.The backlight keyboard looks fantastic, no brightness settings so they can be toggled on or off.The keyboard feels great, makes you want to type things for no reason.The track pad is large and feels pretty nice, not as nice as a MacBook but pretty darn good. The track pad can be toggled on and off.You get enough USB ports, 2x USB 2 and one USB 3.1. I transferred files from a SSD through the USB 3.1 port and hit rates over 500MB/s which made me happy. Transferring large video files from my camera is virtually instantaneous.I'm happy they put in USB port on the right side which I use for my wireless mouse. I've had issues with my MacBook connecting with my worked mouse because there is no USB port on the right side and the aluminum body often times interfered with the connection to the mouse.The speakers get loud enough for me but don't expect to be blown away by them - it is after a laptop and generally I have my headphones on anyhow..I upgraded the ram to 16gb and added a 1tb SSD and was out the door for $450.You really can't get a laptop specked like that for $450 - totally happy with this product.This is definitely the best $300 laptop right now, get the acer, not Asus, not Lenovo..

Without those upgrades it would probably be ok for office tasks and minimal web browsing.  For the price and even after upgrading the ram and hard drive I think it's well worth it for the money.  You can step up in price for the laptop but will not have that much ram.  The NVMe drive seems quick and now that I have the additional hard drive I don't have to worry about space.  The install of parts wasn't to bad.  Take out all the screws on the bottom, peal apart and install parts.  Separating the bottom was a little difficult, very well fit, so if you're hesitant in computer work, ask for help.  It took some finesse.  It almost feels like you'll break something so just go slow.  Back to the laptop.The screen is very good.  No problems with brightness and angles.  The speakers are ok, but then again this is a cheap laptop.  They're definitely better than some others I had but just keep a set of earbuds with it and you'll be fine.  Plus no one wants to listen to what you want, so just plug in for everyone's sake.  The battery life is ok.  I might be able to get about 6 hours out of it.  Haven't done a full test yet, only have used it for about 2 hours at a time.  Just over 2 hours of online use is dropping it to about 60%.The keyboard is pretty good.  Types pretty well.  The numpad is a little small but for the size of the laptop it's to be expected.  I would rather have it than not.  I do like the backlight.  Yes it times out after a couple of seconds.  But it does not turn off while you are using it.  It times out to conserve the battery.  I saw complaints about that but why would you want the backlight to stay on even when you're not tying?  Just doesn't make any sense.  I think it's fine.  Touchpad seems fine, but at this price point I didn't expect greatness.  I usually use a mouse anyway.  All in all I think this is a great deal especially is you upgrade the parts.  Lightweight, looks good, works good, and all my friends ask how it's so good at a good price.",,,,,,,,"2 people found this helpful","This thing is Awesome!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RSWIF42M3HV2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2019","27708","3503","Style: R3 3200U"

I'm extremely impressed.- Screen is excellent. Crisp, high contrast, 1080P display, with a bezel thin enough the laptop isn't much bigger than most with 14"" displays.- The computer is fast. Not super fast, it's not an R7 or i7 powering this thing, but a Rizen 3 is hugely better than the Celeron you'd expect in a laptop or PC for this price. Likewise the graphics are unspectacular but more good enough, you may well find most of your Steam library works well on this thing.- There's a full keyboard! With a numeric keypad! And a touchpad that has a clicky surface which has become standard lately and is so much better than the ""did the user tap me or just shake when moving the mouse? Oh I'll do whatever the worst possible thing is"" touchpads of old.On the negatives:- What can be said about Windows 10S that everyone else hasn't commented on? It's easy to upgrade, but nobody in their right mind is going to use it by default given you can't install Chrome or Firefox on it, so why start it in S mode to begin with?- And Windows 10 is getting more and more creepy. It refuses to let you set it up with a local account, requiring you have an account with Microsoft and only giving you the option of removing the cloud ""Microsoft knows who you are and what you do"" nonsense after you've installed it - and then only if you're technically inclined enough to know what you're doing. I wonder if it's even possible to set it up without an Internet connection.- The keyboard itself... is it me, or have computer manufacturers forgotten how to make keys? The last few laptops I've bought or used have keyboards that would have embarrassed Sir Clive Sinclair. Apparently Apple set the trend that keyboards don't have to work well, and everyone followed them forgetting that Macbooks are just meant to look pretty, so it doesn't matter if their keys are unpleasant to type on.But... this is an impressive laptop, and I have no problems recommending it.",,,,,,,,"One person found this helpful","Bargain","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35E8S4O0JNKNB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2020","27708","3503","Style: R3 3200U"

It isn't going to play the high-end games or perform heavy video editing but it can do everything else without a hiccup.  To make sure it was going to run as fast as possible I did a few things to keep the speed up.1- I HATE the new ""S Mode"" that Microsoft sets up their operating system in as it is purely a marketing ploy to make you have to use their apps instead of apps that work the best.  You want to opt out of that ignorance immediately after powering the laptop up.2- I did a fresh install of Win10 from the MS site after the unpacking process was finished.  This wipes out all of the Acer-based utilities that are a waste of resources.  A fresh install guarantees an operating system without bloatware or manufacturer nonsense.3- I ordered an 8GB stick of RAM at the same time I ordered the laptop so after my fresh install was done updating I shut it down and popped in the extra RAM.  That made 12GB of RAM which will handle anything I ever want to do.  While in the back of the laptop (to install the RAM) I noticed the SSD was the M.2 style!!  SSD's are faster than the old HDD drives but many budget laptops use a SSD that is little more than an HDD with RAM memory inside.  This original SSD is still slowed by using a SATA connection, which is unable to handle true SSD transfer speeds.  This laptop has the M.2 style drive that is directly connected to the motherboard using a PCI bus!  That allows the SSD to transfer data much faster than the older SSDs.  What a great surprise!4- I also found room and the hardware to put an additional drive in the laptop so I grabbed a HDD I had on the shelf and put it in.  That gave me a TB of mass storage for the files that eat up space (photos, videos, music), and now the 156GB SSD will never be filled up by my files.The little budget Acer laptop that I bought for a few hundred dollars became a super-fast beast that can hold all the file I could ever put in it.  It is free of the garbage that came on it, and is my favorite PC now!  (I have 4 other PCs around the house)This laptop is a great little machine out of the box but with a little 'know how' you can make it as nice as anything at twice the money.  The only reason I dropped down to 4 stars is due to the 'S Mode' that turned on by default.

Looks nice, and started up with no problem.o Fast. It only came with 4 GB RAM and a 128K solid-state drive, but even under those conditions it starts up amazingly fast and seems pretty much unflappable. I guess the AMD chipset is a good one.o Lots of ports. Internal upgrade options.After a couple of days of making sure it was okay, I installed an 8 GB Crucial RAM strip. (Which, by the way, doesn't seem to make any difference in laptop speed, for what I'm doing.)I'm used to opening up the aluminum case on a Mac laptop; for this one, however, you must gently work it open with a thin blade, making sure that you don't break the plastic tabs. Sort of like opening a plastic toy that wasn't intended to be user-serviceable.As others have mentioned, there is a dedicated space for a second drive, so I put in one of those (Samsung 860 Evo, 500 GB, great price on Amazon). I followed directions from a You Tube video, and it took perhaps 2 hours. Initially I installed the drive upside down. Also, I discovered that the drive needed to be formatted using the Windows utility (FDisk, I think), which wasn't exactly intuitive. So I had to try a few different formatting options before it worked.Cons:o Not a whole lot of battery life on standard Windows energy settings. It indicates 7 hours, but I don't think I was getting anywhere near that. For my current use it's always plugged in.o The screen is a little dim. I didn't realize this until I compared it side-by-side with my 2011 Mac laptop. You would think that a 2020 Acer screen would make a 10-year-old Mac's screen look dim by comparison, but it's exactly the opposite!o The screen out of the box is set to a lower resolution than the native LCD resolution, so the text is a bit blurry: not good for detail work. However, when I changed it in Windows to the native resolution, the text is waaay too tiny for my aging eyes.o The keyboard (and trackpad) are offset to the left, to make room for a ten-key pad and a few other (pretty much useless) things. Everything being offset like that takes some getting used to. The keys seem to be good quality, but the offset is a strange design choice.Right now these things aren't too much of an issue, because I am using it to drive an external screen, and controlling it with a wireless keyboard from my bicycle (Zwifting through covid!).",,,,,,,,"","Worked fine out of the box.

I wish it came with more than 4GBs of ram, but upgrading that to 8GBs is an easy $20 upgrade or so. Main points with more detail at the bottom:- Good screen, but not super bright. My model didn't have a touch screen, but that's fine by me, I don't want fingerprints all over it anyway- Decent speakers- Good battery life- Good keyboard, typing feels okay- Okay trackpad, can be annoying sometimes- Fast SSD, it boots up fast- Okay for light gamingThe screen has GREAT colors, I was pleasantly surprised. Decent viewing angles, but it's not the brightest screen, I'd say about 300 lumens or so. Usable during the day, even with some sunlight, and it won't burn your eyes at night if you accidentally leave the brightness all the way up, it's in a good spotThe NvMe drive is plenty fast for booting up and launching programs, but at 128GBs, you'll want to add a 1TB Hard Drive for around $40 if you need to store more than just a few documents and not too many programs.This laptop can do some light gaming, plays light games like Cuphead at 60fps on battery or plugged in. Portal 2 over 100fps when plugged in, and it's GREAT to stream games through Steam if you already have a gaming desktop and a good Internet connection. Otherwise, don't expect to run AAA titles like Call of Duty or Apex Legends with this, it's more for indie titles or small gamesBattery usually lasts me around 5 hours or more, with the brightness usually turned up a bit, so I can watch YouTube, Netflix, etc. or listen to music and do homework for a while. I usually don't use speakers to watch or listen to stuff, but they can be decently loud, I like that it has a headphone jack and Bluetooth so I can use any type of headphonesTrackpad is okay, feels nice and has some good gestures. It supposedly uses Windows Precision Drivers, but I'm not too sure. Sometimes while typing my palm will move the trackpad so it jitters in the spot, which is a bit annoying but easily ignoredThe one con about this laptop is that the backlight for the keyboard turns off basically 5 seconds after you don't touch the keyboard.

It gets the job done, is laid out well, and I had no issues, until I did. The right click on the mousepad developed a ""crunch"" when I pressed it. It was still under warranty. I didn't like it, but I had to send it in for it to be repaired under the warranty. Acer sends very specific instructions, including a mailing label for you to send it in. Well, upon arrival, I got a call from the service department saying that when they received my computer, the screen was cracked, and therefore the warranty was void. I would have to pay for the repairs. I've really been working on not getting upset with people on the phone, but I definitely set a new personal record for number of cuss words on one call. I had wrapped this computer in a gargantuan amount of one inch and larger bubble wrap. I greatly exceeded the amount they required in their instructions. I asked repeatedly how a closed, flat laptop, protected by that much bubble wrap, could POSSIBLY have had the screen cracked during shipping. I explained the impossibility of it, and said that the outer parts would have to have been damaged as well, and that I couldn't imagine that a garbage crusher could have damaged it as wrapped as it was. I was told, ""THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME."" Really??? Ok. So... ALL THE TIME, people's warranties are voided because their computers arrive with ""cracked screens."" Yea... I believe they probably do. (Wink, wink.) What a scam! It would have been LITERALLY impossible for my screen to have become cracked during shipping. I told her to send it back immediately. At this point, she put me on hold, saying she would see if there was something she could work out. She came back and asked if I had insured the package. Uh, no. I followed the directions Acer sent, reading every, single, word, very carefully, at least three times. I printed the shipping label they provided, and dropped it at the post office. Oh! Well then, we'll go ahead and fix it at no charge.If this isn't a scam, then I don't know what is. Because of this, I will NEVER buy another Acer product.

That said, tech heads like me have a thing for diamonds in the rough and seeing what kind of performance we can squeeze out of a machine. Acer has one of the better line ups of affordable laptops with a system for all kinds of budgets and Aspire 5 with Ryzen and Vega 3 is at the very bottom of their entry level devices. I'll go straight to the point here, at the retail price of $350 you are mostly getting a nice display. The rest is probably going to be unacceptable to anyone looking for a decent level of performance to do...well mostly anything. It's not going to run video editing, video capture, or higher end games well, if at all. You don't want this as your Media Creation device as it just doesn't have enough power to handle that kind of stuff. Word processing, spreadsheets, Internet browsing, and youtube videos/TV streaming are what this laptop is mainly geared for. The only way you're really going to open up the possibilities for this laptop is to, as other reviews suggest, get out of Windows S mode, and invest in adding more RAM and installing a second 2.5"" SSD. All of these things can be done fairly easily by most people and Acer even has videos online that show you how to handle the hardware part. I ended up spending an additional $120 for 2 sticks of 8 gb RAM and a 1tb SSD so my total cost (after Black Friday deal) was just under $380. For not much more money than many Chromebook models (yuck), I got a solid travel laptop with Windows 10 that I can use as a secondary computer and not worry that I spent a ton of money on.  You can even play games on this thing--provided you install the dedicated graphics drivers from AMD (called Adrenaline). I was able to get Red Dead Redemption Online running, albeit not particularly well. But that the game runs at all is kind of amazing considering even high end PCs have had problems with it. Overall, I can see why this is a top seller on Amazon, but in the end, if you want an ""out of the box"" experience that just gets you up and running quickly, you should really look at upping your budget. If you want a backup laptop for travelling, and are willing to put in a bit more money and time into getting the performance up to speed (literally), then this is probably best laptop value on Amazon right now.",,,,,,,,"One person found this helpful","Aspires to be More, But Honestly Save Your Money for Something Better","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTHI39PB8DYSQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2019","5705","865","Style: R3 3200U"

The GPU appears to reserve 1GB of the available 4GB installed memory, the system will have near to 3GB available when operating. I'm a little surprised that Windows 10 operates with that little memory. An additional 4GB memory module is fairly inexpensive and it looks like the GPU will reserve a 1GB chunk on the second memory stick so you will have about 6GB available, which is plenty for most applications and the GPU will be happy. I was able to install 2x8GB memory modules for about $60, so memory is not a big issue. Part of what sold me on this is the NVMe boot SSD. The speed is disappointing,1.6GB read and 420MB/s write. The read speed is good, but the write speed is more like a high end SATA SSD. The brand name NVMe on my desktop runs 2.6/1.6GB read/write speeds with the same test utility. Not a deal breaker, just something to be aware of. I did install a WD blue 500GB SSD into the expansion slot. It runs 350/305 MB/s read/write which, again, is not bad but could be better. Battery life, screen brightness, and audio are acceptable for a laptop.Having said all of that, I did purchase a second one of these for my personal/work use. I am adding a good quality NVMe boot SSD with 16GB memory. I am also adding a 1TB WD Blue SSD. The Ryzen 3 CPU is a mid/low end model that most people will be absolutely happy with, I am. I do some programming with the Microsoft Visual Studio tools. This works well.Be aware that the installed Microsoft Office tools are trial versions that lead you to a 360 subscription service which, to me, is not worth 1 cent. LibreOffice is an open source suite that can accomplish many of the same functions without draining your bank account on a monthly basis.If you keep this in S mode, you cannot even install a Zoom client.

Screen is clear. Starts up easily. Tons of bloatware to clean up--overwhelming at first. It's hard to know what some of the Acer apps do--Jumpstart, for example--even if you Google them. (I wound up deleting it.) The Microsoft apps are pretty overwhelming, too. It's a very small hard drive so cleaning out unneeded programs is important, but if you don't know what the programs are for, it's a big job. RAM mystified me. Hardware ate up a half Gigabyte when it had 4 GBs RAM. I added another 4 GBs RAM and the hardware then ate up 2 GBs. From other reviews, I understand no matter how much additional RAM you add, the hardware gluttony halts at 2 GBs. But if hardware could operate on half a Gig when it had 4 GBs RAM, why would it require 2 Gigs when the RAM is 8 GB? I added the exact same RAM stick as the manufacturer's used, so that wasn't it. And I used the Windows memory analytics tool to confirm the 2 sticks were both working right. Last, the battery issue. This may not have been due to an Acer issue but I'll never know. Some guy has been hacking my computers for years and amuses himself by wreaking havoc. The battery indicator worked sometimes, and sometimes it was nuts--like it showed amber when it was almost full, or it reported it would be fully charged in 22 minutes when it was in the high eighties (something like that) but reported it would take 40 minutes of charging to top it off when the meter said it was at 94%. So--useless, and I've only had the laptop a week or so. Hopefully the battery issue will disappear if the hacker leaves it alone, but I believe my last laptop would have lasted longer if he hadn't messed with it all the time, so we'll see how this one survives.

The laptop arrived in a very large box with the laptop in its box rattling around with just one little piece for protection.  Although the box the laptop (inside) was packed in was good, it could have easily been broken.The laptop is a great size and screen visibility is great.  It has a touch pad, but the screen is not touch. It also has a full numeric keypad and lighted keys - both good options.It comes as an ""S"" version.  What that means is that you cannot load programs - you have to download applications from Microsoft (which are limited.)  So you can put on the MS Office Suite, use it for e-mails, surf the Internet and save any documents.  What you can't do is load programs like Quicken, etc.  The version on which you can load programs is the ""Home"" version.  See the comments above.  You can switch this over to a ""Home"" version with no cost, but that decision cannot be reversed.  So the way I would describe it is that it comes kind of like a tablet (except no touch screen), but it can become a computer.I have very high speed broadband and the laptop is very quick.  I also don't need a a lot of storage as I save to the cloud and don't play video games or use anything else which requires a huge amount of storage.For the price and for using the Internet, e-mail, and the Office Suite, it is great and a tremendous value.  It is difficult to get a computer that looks this nice and does this much for less than $400!The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think the difference between ""S"" and ""home"" should be explained to the consumer w/o having to look in the comments section, as well as an explanation that the ""S"" version means you have to use applications and not programs.

Watching videos, web browsing, emails, office work, and even light gaming (non AAA titles obviously) this laptop does very well. The screen isn't super bright but is more than enough for basic tasks and the speakers are adequate. There are a few things that I want to point out and they're as followed:-Only 4GB RAM.. The integrated GPU shares the memory (2GB) so you're really only working with 2GB. Even though this laptop has an NVME SDD, running on Windows 10 with only 2GB of RAM can only do so much, especially if you have multiple tabs open on your browser or opening folders. Luckily there is another slot to add another stick of RAM (plus it'll run in dual channel so better performance) so do yourself a favor and get another 4GB stick.-No light indicator for the Lock keys (CAP,NUM,SCROLL). I like using the number pad. It's a bit of a nuisance especially if your typing a password. The number pad shares function with the home/end, page up/down keys and are defaulted to those functions. You'll need to press the NUMLock key to use the number pad but without a light indicator you can easily forget that it's on and end up scrolling through web pages if your typing, or trying to input numbers and end up scrolling up and down on web pages (funny and annoying at the same time).-Limited storage. Again, luckily there is a slot in which you can add a 2.5' SSD for more storage space.-Windows 10 in S Mode... Don't use it otherwise you're forced to use only Apps in the windows store. There are video tutorials on youtube of how disable S Mode. **After initially setting up your laptop, you may have to activate windows first (I had to) in order to see the option to not use S Mode.**All in all the issues I listed are EASILY fixable. Adding another 4GB stick of RAM and more storage will cost you an extra $75.00+ (depending on storage capacity) but it's worth it in my opinion and I highly recommend it if you decide to purchase this laptop.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71i6zAlqbjL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,"2 people found this helpful","Overall great laptop for the price","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2H995IE5VDT0J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2020","5705","865","Style: R3 3200U"

I use it mostly to work online and it is able to easily browse the web and keep multiple tabs running. However, I did have to upgrade the RAM from 4GB to 8GB to make it work even smoother. Chrome is really a RAM hogger. I have not added a hard drive as I don't store photos or other media on my computer but the option is there if you need more space. And, though it came in Windows S Mode, I easily removed that limitation and activated the full version of Windows 10. Here's what I like and don't like:The backlit keyboard works as it should and I like that you can manually turn it on and off.The keyboard is comfortable to use (though not as quiet as I'd like when typing).The screen is bright and has good viewing angles.It starts up really fast. Like... 1.2 seconds with custom antivirus and under 1 second without it. Shuts down in the blink of an eye too.All the standard ports you need (no USB C though).What don't I like?The SOUND. My phone's speaker provides louder sounds than this computer. Luckily, I have headphones (you'll need them).If you don't upgrade the RAM you'll experience lag and hangs (depending on what you're doing). Even at 8 GB, it hangs sometimes. I think I'll go for 16 GB. This is because even at 8GB the system reserves 2GB for the graphics card so you really only get 6GB to use for other tasks.Definitely not for hardcore gaming! Don't buy if you want to play video games (games that you can stream are fine though). For reference, with 8GB I can safely play League of Legends, Legends of Runeterra, and Teamfight Tactics without lag. And I can stream games via Stadia with no problems.

The top rated laptop on Amazon. I purchased this laptop in June of 2020 and it has been an excellent purchase. I am a full time professional and part time student, and this laptop is used mainly for my classes as I have workstation at my office. For simple tasks (email, office applications, streaming videos, light gaming) this laptop works perfect. I plan to upgrade the 4gb of RAM to 8gb at some point, but after using it has become less of a priority. It works great out of the box. No issues running multiple Chrome browsers, streaming Spotify, and having emails open in the background.Best part to me is the screen quality. It is a huge step up from my older HP laptop and I am very happy with it.2 small issues I have with this laptop are: Battery life and keyboard feel.Battery seems to charge fast, but lose charge faster. I have not seen it have more than 4.5 hours battery life with everything closed and battery saver on full. At normal use I usually get about 3-3.5 hours. If you plan to use this everyday on the go, on train rides, etc....I would consider looking at something with a longer battery life. For me it is fine as I will be using it at home or where an outlet would be available if necessary.Keyboard is not as big of an issue. It is hard to describe but I feel as though the keys should be deeper / more recessed (?). It almost feels like there is not enough feedback and when you are typing at certain angles it sometimes feels like you are barely pressing at all. Not a huge concern, and it could just take getting used to a bit more.Overall, for $370 all in, this is a good deal. Good design, nice enough hardware, and amazing screen resolution.

In the near future i will put in a either a 1TB or 2TB SSD harddrive and prob upgrade the RAM on this thing.I have had this laptop for a week so far no real cons to it.I just wanted to add that this is my 3rd Acer and I don’t have any complaints about any of it.9/9/19 edit - for whatever reason this laptop drops it's connection to the wifi - not sure why - all my other laptops stay connected.10/23/19 - i put JRiver Media Center on this instead using the glitchy Windows Media Player that seemed to turn my music network off whenever it suit it- fidgety and tempermental - not the fault of the hardware.  Also i am not able to access music files from another PC through WMP due to its unstable connection.  JRiver works well - was able to access this dedicated laptop as audio source wirelessly11/26/20 still using this to access online content to bring tv since my tv isn’t “smart” its still working.

But I wanted a backlit keyboard (woo hoo) without paying $1,000 and decent memory to play simple computer games.  This cost about $100 more than I wanted to spend too.My $250 -- approx 9 month old Dell is JUNK. The key letters wore off at about month 5, and after the 1st update, it lacked memory for the 2nd Windows UPDATE.  The Dell website did NOT disclose that it was OUTDATED MODEL.So I came to Amazon, because I could look at the top 40 selling list and see what other people, based on their knowledge and research, were purchasing.  THAT IS HOW I SELECTED THIS LAP TOP.Out of the box -- plug it in, plugged into my ethernet cable1st challenge -- turn off Microsoft S Setting so I could install programs NOT in MS store2nd challenge -- junk programs that I did NOT ask for -- remove xbox and MS Office, etc.3rd irritation -- stickers on the panel near touch screen & keypad left STICKY STUFF right where my wrist rests.  I imagine rubbing alcohol may damage the paint so it may take me MONTHS to remove this sticker mess residue. MAJOR IRRITATIONSet up -- out of box set up, plugged into ethernet -- took roughly 10 to 20 minutes -- but I'm not a techie and I needed to find my Windows account information and passwords to add my Google Mail.  So if you have existing MS Account get that from your settings on MS Edge / Explorer before you begin. Ditto for Apple account etc.Speed -- wow so much nicer than the comparable priced OUT of date Dell that I've had the past yearKeyboard -- love the back light ( BIG ^5) AND it is farther apart on keys but I'm adjusting.  I thought I'd not like the 10 key on end but I don't notice it.Updates -- so far no major Windows Updates have been neededFirst impression, I am very pleased. It will take a few weeks to get all the settings like my old computer and get all the account passwords transferred to this computer. I thought when I logged onto my Google Account that it would do that -- maybe I've missed that step.INTERNET SUGGESTION FOR SET UP -- Be sure to give your computer a UNIQUE DEVICE NAME on your internet service provider as you set that up.  My technical support advised me yesterday that was potentially one of my problems that I was having FYI.NOTE - WHY CABLE VERSUS WIRELESS -- I used ethernet cable so did not do wireless at ALL on the set up.  There are 20 modems with 5G within reach of this laptop -- it weakens the signal for me to use wireless inside my apartment per Sparklight technical support.UPDATE July 5th -- I keep loosing the SOUND -- I've reset the settings 3 times already to restore the SOUND -- this is why Microsoft should not be a monopoly (Update#3 so far, now the sound is here all the time YEAH ME)UPDATE Dec -- the ethernet  / folding socket has a ""spring"" to expand it for the cord, right? so... it is annoying as the dickens to be in the middle of being on line and the CORD COMES UNCLICKED so EASILY!! I am replacing my cord and upgrading it -- but just FYI that feature seems to be a defective design flaw.

But after a little over a month (and having really only used it 3 or 4 times in that month), the screen went black but the back-light on the keyboard was still on. So, I figured it just needed to be charged. I left it plugged in for a few hours and then checked on it. Still, lit keys but no screen. So I changed to a different outlet and left it to charge some more. Came back to it, same thing. I tried following their support suggestion of resetting the battery using the tiny button in the back but it made no difference. I never took it out of ""S"" mode, and never even downloaded any apps or installed any programs. Basically, just checked my email a few times. Now when I plug it in, nothing lights up. The adapter on the charger doesn't have any indicator light to show that it's working, so it could be a faulty power cord.I'm going to attempt to call their customer support line and see if they can provide me any answers.

A rice cooker I ordered could NOT be plugged into a wall outlet. I had to return it.  I understand that this Acer was not a top of the line computer, BUT....  The electrical plug/power cord does NOT fit into the computer without having to force it. I should not have to use force to connect. Luckily, I had a cord from an HP laptop that fits better.  Also, when I plug my headphones into the computer... NOTHING. Nada. No sound from the headphones, just the regular sound from the computer's (weak) speakers. What the heck ?!?!?!  Gaming? Forget it....  I do like and am completely sold on the SSHD, solid state hard drive.  4 GB ram used to be a lot. Not anymore. With Win10 as an OS, this computer is under powered...  It is a good computer for standard student use, writing reports, etc.  Would I recommend it? It is relatively cheap, but if this is an example of Acer's quality control, then definitely not.

I purchased three of these PC Laptops for my clinic (external use; not for patient data).  It took me TWO HOURS to set them up.  I put all three on the countertop and just went from one to the other. This is what I always do.  There's always irritation to work around with setting up computers but these were the worst ones yet.  You have to ensure you don't connect them to the internet during setup because if you do ... YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY sign in with your Microsoft account (or create another one).  They have completely removed the ""create local account"" (the traditional way to log in).  If you entered your wireless network info, you have to (a) unplug your modem and (b) restart the computer and start the set-up all over again because there is no way to ""back up"" to the network entry section.  So terrible.  Because they removed the option to choose a local account, their reasoning for this is simply to control you and your computing experience.  For personal use, this may be okay.  For corporate use, not a chance!  The security problems are incredible with this setup.  You're going to get sued!  So -- after this ordeal, windows is set up.  First thing I ALWAYS do is install Google Chrome and then make it default.  Well, MS made that practically impossible too!  There's now a standard ""Windows S Mode Edition.""  This is purportedly to prevent you from installing unauthorized content to save your computer.  This is nonsense.  It's a way to ensure everyone uses their crappy MS Edge browser.  Their browser always sucked.  Their browser currently sucks.  Their browser will always suck.  That's why people get rid of it.  But they force you to use it.  You have to now download some app that turns MS S Mode off (that MS makes and publishes).  That would be fine, but now Windows uses a digital copy instead of a key and the digital license ... you guessed it ... could not be verified.  Yep, several restarts, updates, and other bologna and finally I was able to install the S Mode bypass so that I could download Chrome.  Then there's the bloatware.  There is so much packaged into windows that bloats it!  I don't want my employees to play any number of games or waste time on unproductive processes.I have yet to really dive in to the computer but superficially, it looks fine.",,,,,,,,"20 people found this helpful","Bloatware.

I bought this to replace an old Dell Latitude, and I have mixed feelings.  When it works, it's great.  But the plastic frame is super flimsy and easily broken, particularly around the power cable connection.  I think the plastic around the hole was cracked within a few weeks, and now I have a big crack running all the way to the Esc key in the top left.  I had this problem with an old HP laptop, and after a couple of years it was just crunchy with cracks, and I think this one is going the same direction.  Even sitting with it on my lap, I can see the plastic flex and the crack widen and narrow depending on how I'm holding it.Performance wise it is good 90% of the time.  I can play a lot of the sidescroller Steam games, like Salt & Sanctuary and Child of Light.  But it is prone to odd slowdowns every now and then.  Which is really frustrating since I upgraded the RAM to 16 GB.  I still haven't figured out why it has these slowdowns, but it seems to be related to the power cable. For example, if it becomes unplugged while gaming, the performance crashes instantly.  And since the plastic around the power cable port is cracking and breaking, it's not always a snug fit to know if the power cable is connected in such a way that it is actually feeding power to the device.  Being unable to charge the laptop without pushing the power cable in just so is what ultimately led me to junk my old HP, so I'm sad to be reliving the same silly defect 15 years later.Anyway, I'll use this until it is impossible to do so, but I'm also thinking I should have stuck with the Latitude series from Dell since they build more robust laptops.  If you plan on leaving this on your desk, it's probably a good deal.  but if you plan to use this on your lap and take it with you places, it's probably not hardy enough for that life.",,,,,,,,"3 people found this helpful","decent hardware, especially after upgrading, but very flimsy build.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UD8KGIW71BDP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2020","1576","406","Style: R3 3200U"

Once I opened my my new acer laptop and let it complete it's mandatory software update, it left my computer with zero internal memory (116 GB used), this is a major issue and I even uninstalled a large majority of apps not required to run. I have an external 8 TB connected and anything new saving on as well as installed 16 GB of internal RAM which has helped the processing tremendously and is rather fast. My extreme issue is nothing else can be done...no Micrisoft Office, nothing but literally check my email....if I try anything else I get a message there isn't enough internal memory.......Argh......very frustrating. I've purchased an internal 1TB SSD that should arrive soon and I'm hoping this fixes this constant issue I'm experiencing. In addition, I've purchased an external dvd HD drive for watching dvds if possible but currently no internal memory allows nothing but email as of right now.I have mixed feelings on this laptop as it's my first 1 in 21 years and am leaving room for learning but I do know it shouldn't be like this. A rather expensive tasking to make a laptopwork....I will post more once I install the additional memory. Thank goodness this laptop is built with the ability to upgrade and maybe that's the goal of the company...nevertheless less; I supplied 3 stars for screen quality, user friendly set-up, once the RAM upgrade was completed it's very fast and the ability to customize the laptop with tools for reference (you tube videos).UPDATE: I reset the computer back to factory settings and the remounted the additional memory and it's working very well as it should. It's definitely faster than my old Toshiba of 21 years however, the motherboard and processor on this seem to being fine (I only do minor things no video games). Excellent image and crisp images.

Both about the same price and both in windows S-mode.  I'm only commenting on 2 things.  Between the Asus & Acer, setting up the thing was less stressful with the Asus with far less questions and monopoly from Microsoft.  Setting up the Acer took much longer and was forced to set up with a Microsoft account which can be changed later.  2nd thing, going through the process to get OUT of S-mode/Microsoft control was much easier on the Asus then the Acer. I'm not going to lie it was bordering brutal to get out of the S-mode on this Acer. And a comment on my favorite feature which is why I wanted to compare the Asus v/s the Acer was for the backlit keyboard on these cheaper laptops.  Again the Asus tops the Acer. The Asus backlit keyboard stays on longer, comes on if you tap the touchpad or move the mouse if you use a mouse.  The Acer (this Model) goes off quick and will not come on if you touch the touchpad, will not come on if you move the mouse and this model does not have a setting to set preferences for the keyboard timeout. So for me YES I would order the Asus again but would not order the Acer again. Oh and for anyone wondering about speaker volume? Both the Asus and the Acer were horrible! turn the sound up to 100 and couldn't hear either one of them.

The inner components  are easy to access, giving the impression that the engineers had personal upgrades in mind.- The screen clarity is excellent.  Much clearer and brighter screen than other similarly priced laptops that I have  owned.- Battery life should be adequate for most users.- The keyboard has a good feel to it.  Typing for long periods of time is not a problem.- The machine is lightweight.  Easy to carry in a backpack if you’re a college student.- The look is professional and sleek.  This laptop looks at home in both classroom and office settings.- The price is very competitive for the overall quality.  You’ll be hard pressed to find something better than this for less than $400.Cons:- The sound projection is not the best.  I believe the speakers are at the bottom of the laptop.  When placed on certain surfaces, the sound can be muffled.  I would recommend a decent pair of headphones if sound projection is important to you.- The provided hardware, while adequate, is still lacking.  Any modern Windows machine should have at least 8 GB of RAM installed.  Despite this, adding the additional 4GB is very easy.  There are plenty of very accessible resources that explain what type of RAM to purchase, and exactly how to install it.  The 128 GB of provided storage will most likely be enough for most but adding an additional SSD for some added storage is also a simple process.- The touchpad doesn’t feel as intuitive as some others.  Those who have need for very precision clicking, or those who are easily annoyed by a finicky touchpad, should invest in a mouse.Conclusion:The Acer Aspire 5 is a great laptop for the price you’re paying.  For most people, simply adding another 4 GB of RAM will result in a very cheap machine that can perform just about any task you might need it to.  Of course, if you need to run any sort of very large or complex software, such as CAD or digital design, you will need to invest in a more powerful machine.

Two days, so that was nice. I wasn't looking for a top of the line gaming laptop or anything and I don't have any serious software that I intend to run on it. It's just for idling around and having something to work with while traveling or being in other locations.Pros:- Budget laptop for sure, but runs well.- Upgradable. I added in an additional 256 GB SSD and upgraded the RAM to 16 GB. It runs smooth, boots fast, and I haven't had any issues with functionality. It takes a few minutes to do but there's videos on youtube to show you how.- You can, for FREE, opt out of Windows S mode. Some comments say you have to pay to get out and, frankly, they aren't even trying. You need to register your product key first and then go to the Windows Store and type in something akin to ""get out of Windows S mode"". Google it. It's easy.- Light weight.- Good battery.- Backlit keyboard.Cons:- Sound is weird. It sounds like it's all coming from beneath the laptop and somewhat muffled, so if you're actually using this to listen to music I would recommend headphones.- Amazon basically advertises this laptop when a newer version of that laptop is out. I wish I had gone there; it's only about sixty dollars more for the newer model with a better processor. But, this will serve.- Biggest issue: The screen quality is not the best. Mine over-saturates colors and no matter how much I play with the gamma, brightness, contrast, or color balancing, I can't get it to look as good as I would on a normal desktop screen. It's almost as though there's a resolution issue, but things still appear in 1080p. I'm not sure how to describe it. It's just odd.

I'm going to skip the positives, because everyone knows this is an affordable laptop that mostly gets the job done for browsing/school/work. It looks fine, seems solid. However, so far the battery life is going a little quicker than I would like. I'm going to keep it on until it drains to see how many hours I actually get out of it.The other thing to be aware of is there is no advanced settings for RAM in the BIOS. I'm not technically adept enough to say that it matters on this machine. All I know is I replaced the 4gb RAM stick with a single 16gb stick and performance in task manager says I'm getting 2400 out of it. If it was able to be overclocked I believe I'd be able to get all 2666hz out of the RAM but again I'm not sure as my knowledge of this stuff is limited. I did not do a thorough diagnostic but may update this review with one through cpu-z at some point.*EDIT*Updated to 5 stars. So I'm not 100% on this, but I'm pretty sure the quick battery drain was due to the OS. Once I disabled Windows 10 S, to just regular Windows, the battery drain slowed down quite a bit. The power setting in "" Windows S"" was 2 or 3 spots away from full performance mode. When switched out of ""S""(a horrible OS btw, I suggest to get rid of it), the power setting switched to a balance mode. Either way, the battery life greatly improved. So anyhow, for the price this laptop is definitely worth 5 stars so far 👍*YET ANOTHER EDIT*Changed to 4 stars. The battery life is crap. I'm running Ubuntu which is way less demanding than windows. Even after completely getting rid of windows and using Ubuntu I seem to be averaging somewhere between 5-6 hours of battery life. This is with screen brightness around low-medium, about 4 tabs in Firefox, music playing and an html editor open.

My family purchased 3 and we are all quite happy with them.  It's lightweight, thin and comes packed with the essential features most non-gamers need to work and play.  Plus, it looks great!For the low price, you do give up a few premium features, such as a better CPU, USB-C ports, a large battery and lots of memory and storage.  However, the beautiful 1080p IPS screen, full keyboard layout, spaciousa and responsive touchpad, USB 3.1 ports and stereo speakers easily cover the basics and then some.Plus, memory and hard drive space can be easily upgraded for very little cost, making it possible to match the features of more expensive models without the price tag.The Ryzen 3 processor is plenty fast for most users and the onboard graphics are better than the graphics on Intel's competing i3 and i5 processors.  That said, this laptop does benefit greatly from a small memory upgrade for both speed and graphics performance.  Simply adding a second 4GB stick of DDR4 2400 or 2666 RAM to the free slot inside is all most users will need to get the most out of this laptop.If you plan on gaming heavily, you may want to look elsewhere, as that's not the strength of this particular model.  But, for basic photo/video editing and daily tasks like web browsing, spreadsheets and word processing, the Ryzen cpu with a low-cost 4GB memory upgrade is more than adequate.For users who need more internal storage, Acer has left a slot open inside the laptop which allows a 7mm thick 2.5"" SSD to be added at any time.  With prices falling on SSDs in the 256GB-512GB range, this is a welcome feature and a simple plug-n-play upgrade.Battery life is less than advertised.  Expect around 4 hours of continuous use, compared to the 7+ the manufacturer claims.  I'm assuming the battery can be upgraded to a better one at a later time, since it's easily accessible when the back cover is removed.  However, don't be put off when you find yourself plugging in for a recharge a little sooner than expected.  It's still ""average"" compared to most other laptops.Sound is decent, but not stellar.  Similarly, the trackpad feels a bit ""cheap"" when pressing at the edges, but it works very well and the response is really good overall.All in all, this is a great basic laptop out of the box and just a few dollars put into a couple small upgrades can really go a long way toward maximizing its performance and functionality.Highly recommended!",,,,,,,,"35 people found this helpful","A Solid 4-Star Laptop!

Games and office programs loaded so slow. Even typing a word document seemed to tax the small laptops resources. When videos started to stutter I decided it was time for an upgrade and I am glad I did.Online recommendations pointed me to this or the HP 14 slim as being great windows alternatives for those on a Chromebook budget.Pros:Ryzen: The 3200u ryzen processor is amazing not only do laptops using this processor come at a steep discount to the Intel laptops but in many benchmarks and applications (games) they perform much better. With a memory upgrade many games will run with respectable frame rates at low settings. I am still surprised the games that will run on this laptop like GTA 5.Display and sound: The HD IPS screen display is nice with a 1920 x 1080 screen, The one negative I have seen on it is sound quality but its a big step up from my old Chromebook. I can actually hear this device from across the room when watching a video and the sound has more depth than my previous device.Price: This was in same price range as some Chromebooks with less storage and a lower quality screen. Its an amazing deal.Cons:Memory/storage: This device only has 4 gigs of ram. I have heard that windows 10 on a ryzen system using the APU monopolizes most of that memory. Plan on purchasing an extra stick of 4 gig at least. You will get a 30-40% improvement in performance using ram in duel channel. The 128 gig solid state drive seems a bit underwhelming as well. Most budget laptops have these. There is room to upgrade though.Build quality: There are good things about this build (screen/processor/keyboard/metal top cover) but there was some cost cutting as well. The top of the laptop is covered with metal while the bottom has cheap plastic with a bit of flex to it. The hard drive cable included inside is flimsy and the battery connector cable looks dodgy as well. The open hard drive bay had a laughably cheap plastic hard drive tray that looks like a re purposed zip lock bag. I am not sure of the long term durability of this laptop. I think it should be fine around the house or at work. Because of the build quality I am not sure if this is something that would survive daily commutes to school in a book bag.",,,,,,,,"","I love Ryzen!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JLLIYUQ1MR2N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2020","5705","865","Style: R3 3200U"

I am furthering my education and wanted something for education, light gaming, and streaming some movies every now and then. So here it goes.PROS: Amazing big bright nice resolution screen at this price point! Love the backlit keyboard with nice ergonomic layout (and a nice full size keyboard layout with number pad) Love how they managed to squeeze in an  ethernet port at this price point. Slim sleek design and despite it being plastic it looks premium with the finish. I like how there's USB ports on 2 sides (hate it when USB ports are bunched together). The boot time is nice and I like the capacity of the SSD at this price point though 256GB would be generous (I stored stuff in cloud so not as big of a deal as you'd think). Camera is pretty good I use it in Zoom meetings and it does the job. Big track pad for mouse with lots of real estate to move your fingers on and I like the pinch feature.CONS: For some reason the WiFi signal seems weaker than my other laptops at same distances. Maybe a driver update? BIG CON: The mousepad doesn't seem to engage when you tap on it when you want to click as well as it will select all when it shouldn't (can be frustrating to use once in a while). It can be wonky. Maybe a software driver update needed? Adjusting the touchpad in Windows 10 settings helps a little bit.  I think it wouldn't have hurt that much for Acer to have it include 8GB of RAM at this price point. I do notice a performance hit at 4GB of ram, but again at this price point this does so much and more where I see laptops at $500 price point. Battery life leaves more to be desired. Charges fast but the life on the battery isn't stellar or great. Just good. Another annoying oversight by Acer that's stupid cheap considering they have a backlit keyboard is no indicator light on ""caps lock"" key to let you know whether it's on or off.

Here’s the thing … if you need it for school and browsing the web (several tabs no problem still fast) it’s absolutely perfect. Screen is nice and big so it also works really well to watch your favorite programs. But the downside is the plastic on this laptop is not durable. My problem began a few months ago when a tiny part of the plastic broke on the right bottom corner of the screen. From then on it slowly got worse and worse until it spread to the other side and the laptop couldn’t even hold up its own weight anymore! Nevertheless I still liked it because it did what I needed it to do. But the last 2 months of use it I have needed to prop something heavy behind the screen to hold it up because otherwise it just falls and breaks even more. Anyway when I was trying to fix the sockets that popped out of place I guess a wire that was exposed ripped or something because the screen no longer turns on sadly. The keyboard and light still turns on when I press the power button. Regardless this laptop did not last me that long so even though I was debating on reordering I don’t think it was a smart investment. If you plan on getting this for all the things i liked about it above then go for it! But please please be careful when opening/closing or just handling it in general because otherwise your in for a slow fall into what happened with me. Cheers! (Also I do blame the failure on this laptop mostly on myself but it is only like 400$ so the materials you pay for come in the laptop durability)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716V5t9q6dL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pAN3dXQgL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,"2 people found this helpful","Good … But not great.

Mostly Facebook and email. I immediately upgraded the RAM from 4GB to 16GB with memory I had on-hand, so my review is based on this initial upgrade. We've owned it for about 2 months now.Lets start off with what I like about this laptop. Keep in mind this is weighted by the low price point:- The display is solid, especially at this price point. Every other laptop in this range has a crappy old TN display. This is the real party piece of this laptop.- The aluminum top shell looks nice.- Processor seems adequate, or dare I say it, almost speedy- The SSD also performs well, even if it is on the small side. My wife doesn't store much on her laptop, so this is a non-issue for me.- Battery life is solid. 4 hours of continuous, medium duty use with no issues and 6-8 hours with lighter workloads.- Easy to upgrade. The RAM upgrade was a breeze, and there's even space inside for a 2.5"" SATA drive should you want to go that route instead of NVMe to upgrade storage. If you own an #1 Philips screwdriver and can remember righty-tighty lefty-loosey you should be good to go.This laptop isn't perfect (non of them are), so here's what I'm not crazy about:- The main body of the laptop isn't aluminum, it's plastic. This wouldn't be a big deal except for the fact that the plastic feels cheap. Really cheap. I'd go so far as to say flimsy. This doesn't inspire confidence that it will hold up for the long run, but so far so good.- Ditto on the track pad. It's worse than the track pad from the Chromebook this laptop replaced.- It's very hard to get the connector from the power adapter seated into the charging port. It almost feels like you are going to break something. It's gotten a little better with time though.Well, there it is. A decent performing laptop with questionable build quality. At this price point, that's kind of what I expected. Time will tell how it holds up, but so far, so good. If you have any illusions that this is going to be a budget gaming laptop, let me stop you right there. The processor and on-board video card are fine for normal, day to day tasks, but don't have any illusions about playing the latest video games at acceptable frame rates. Even Minecraft would be a stretch unless you upgrade the RAM like I did.",,,,,,,,"6 people found this helpful","As long as you don't have unrealistic expectations, it's a solid performer","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTT2DF55ME9XK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2019","5705","865","Style: R3 3200U"

I have bought earlier versions a couple times and I like it, but there are some keyboard layout issues you might want to consider. This is not my main text editing computer but when I use it for that, it is a bit of a trial that the up and down buttons are so small and that in NumLock mode which I prefer, the four main movement keys are unaccessible: Home, End, PgUp, and PgDown. Also, the keyboard light times out pretty fast and the onky option to fix it is to go into the bios and turn off the keyboard light timeout – which is not hard but may be daunting for many users. Here's my quick tutorial: 1) Restart computer, 2) when screen goes blank start spamming F2 button including during Acer logo screen and the bios interface will load, 3) use right arrow to get to next page pf bios and look for ""Keyboard light timeout"" which will be set to ""Enabled"", 4) use down arrow to highlight that line and F6 to change it, then F10 to save and exit and confirm with ""Enter"" key.

For starters, some background context: I am in my mid-20s and have long since finished uni. I am not a gamer. I primarily use my laptop(s)/tablets for streaming shows/movies; occasionally working from home; and crafting/design editing. I used to go through every iteration of a MacBook but, while nice, soon found myself not really utilizing all of its features & could no longer justify its price-point (especially since I do still have an iPhone).This laptop is a STEAL for ~$300. I did my research and honestly, like a majority of the other reviews here said, the Acer Aspire 5 blows every other product in its price bracket out of the water. That said, I went into this fully knowing I wanted an inexpensive laptop and that, because of that constraint, whatever I ended up purchasing would most likely have some limitations. If you purchased this and are disappointed about the specs in correlation to it being ~$300.... I really don't know what to tell you other than that you definitely were looking in the wrong place.I solely bought this computer because I recently got a CRICUT Explore Air 2 and needed something compatible with it (Chromebooks won't work and my MacBook is so old it can barely handle the newest OS); however, I already know now that this is going to become my main laptop and I will get a lot of use from it outside of just crafting.THE IMPORTANT STUFF:1.) This is a solidly-built laptop. Very sturdy, very lightweight. Perfect for on-the-go. It IS aluminum though the whole way around, so I recommend buying a case or sleeve to avoid scratching.2.) The screen resolution and sound quality is surprising very good, crisp, and clean - while I think perhaps it could be a tad bit brighter, that's just me being nit-picky. I would still recommend using external speakers if you want to retain the quality of sound at its loudest setting, especially if what you listen to is bass-heavy.3.) Turning off Windows S-Mode was absolutely painless - it's literally just going to the website that's taped on the outside of the box and clicking one or two buttons.4.) Like other reviewers recommended, I did purchase another 8GB of RAM and installed it myself (I googled YouTube videos on how to do this for this specific laptop model; there are plenty of them, just take it slow and you'll be fine). I opted to leave IN the 4GB stick that was already there, thus giving myself a total of 12GB RAM. The difference in speed is HUGE and, like I said, I'm not using this for *too* much other than everyday use. Spend that little bit of extra money if you can, I promise it's worth it! I can't speak to anything as to whether it would hold-up with gaming, but definitely for a solid several hours of streaming content, crafting, and/or having multiple tabs & apps open simultaneously.5.) The track-pad is VERY sensitive. Not so much so that I would take off a star, but enough to notice. I recommend purchasing a wireless mouse if you plan on doing more intricate work to eliminate any annoyance or mistakes. I bought one (a Logitech one, $10) and so far it's definitely made designing and editing much easier.It's been awhile since I've had a PC but it's nice to know that a lot of its shortcomings (such as memory space & speed) can easily be fixed and modified to your preference. Again, at the end of the day, this is NOT a heavyweight laptop, both literally and figuratively speaking, but that's okay because it's not meant to be! Overall, I would highly recommend this computer to anyone who is looking for an everyday laptop that is both budget-friendly without sacrificing too much of its quality.",,,,,,,,"71 people found this helpful","Wonderful Laptop That Won't Break the Bank","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9VOWODH2IGJZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2019","27708","3503","Style: R3 3200U"

I used it two days ago and it was fine. I tried all the troubleshooting for the battery including the manual battery button, power cycling, static draining, and checking the power cord.

The first thing I did was pull the stock memory and storage. I added 16 GB ram and put in 1 tb drives. I installed  Xubuntu Linux, later installed Debian Linux “bookworm” Release. with no driver issues. I added a USB 1 GB Ethernet adapter/hub combo to the 1 USB 3.1 port. This Laptop has a good screen and I like its lighted keyboard. Its Ryzen 3 3200U processor isn't fast, but its fast enough for my needs. I only use this laptop as a VPN internet share laptop for my work at home 2nd local area network. I could use an VPN router for this, but would get much slower internet speeds.  Using the laptop as an VPN share device I always get good internet speeds.  The second laptop I have as a backup, if the Linux OS gets a bad update and fails. It has happened 3 or 4 times where I had to use the backup laptop.  Minimal downtime that way. Always good to have a backup.The only thing I don't like about the laptop is that every so often I will get a blinking battery warning light. When that happens I unplug the ac power to the laptop and let the battery run down to 15%, then plug in the ac power to the laptop and good to go. No more warning light. I pull the bottom cover off once a year to clean the laptop and make sure the battery isn't showing signs of swelling. So far so good.  If that happened I would probably just pull the battery and run the laptop without a battery.  These laptops have been a good value for what I use them for. The laptop performs well running Linux, I would not be running windows on the laptop. I think its processor might be to slow for that.

There are work-arounds and dual booting and dealing with developer mode.  When a recent cheap Chromebook died, I looked for a replacement, but either the work arounds were really slow, or the Chromebooks recommended specifically for that purpose were super expensive.  Then I came across this (again, it is not a chromebook), and figured I'd just install Linux on it and use it for web browsing and connecting to various services on my home network.It worked flawlessly.  The supplied SSD Hard Drive is somewhat small (plenty of room if you do most of your work in the cloud though), but they do supply a mounting kit and if you need it a YouTube video for how to install a larger drive in the computer.  One slightly disappointing thing is that I had a few 1 TB SSDs sitting around, and the plan was to toss one in the laptop and reclaim the 128 GB SSD to use in an enclosure as a USB drive to transfer files/hold a dev env between work and home and support for various friends.  The included 128GB drive is just the chip on a board and doesn't look easily removable, and wouldn't mount in any of my enclosures even if I could remove it.  So, adding a large disk just adds another drive in the OS, it doesn't replace the one it comes with.That actually isn't a big deal as it saved me the hassle of virtualizing the included Windows 10 installation to run on a VM if I ever needed Windows.  After a few false starts where it didn't look like you could boot off of anything but the included SSD (turns out, disabling FastStart in the BIOS lets it book off of a USB key), I was able to verify everything worked fine off a live CD image on USB and it can now just dual boot into windows or linux seamlessly.The memory is a bit tight, and while I was getting everything installed and configured I'd get random pauses.  Adding an 8GB memory stick (easily accessible, especially if you are upgrading the drive and have the cover off already - it just has 10 normal phillips screws, no special tools required) solved that, although I did spend a few days just surfing the web on the laptop and using remote ssh into the home network, and after the initial installation and configuration I rarely saw any problems  while waiting for the memory to arrive.So, for about $22 extra dollars for the RAM, I now have a pretty speedy computer with a nice display, full number pad to the right of the keyboard, much more capable than the Chromebook it replaced for about the same price.  My original plan was to just use it as a web browser and an ssh client into my desktop to do development work on the couch, but it turns out my dev tool chain works perfectly fine on the laptop.  It is slightly slower doing a full compile of projects than the desktop, but that is to be expected, and I don't get any network lags doing thing remotely.  I don't really notice any difference while actually coding or doing small write/compile/test cycles.The only real negative for me so far is that for a new laptop (the manufacture date on the sticker says Oct 2019, but it has to have been designed before that), it still has a specialized charger.  I've got much older laptops that use USB-C charging.  So, that is one more cable on the desktop, one more adapter to move from room to room, one more specialized piece of equipment that will need to be replaced if it goes bad.But, for the price, it isn't a speed demon, but I don't play games except on consoles and with very minor upgrades it works as well as any other PC laptop I've used.  I'm not a Windows guy, but I did use it long enough to switch it from Windows 10 Home S which comes pre-installed to Windows 10 Home (the main difference being you aren't tied to the MS store for application installation , as far as I can tell).  I did install some software and used it and it felt as snappy as any of my work laptops (although, that could be damning with faint praise).",,,,,,,,"5 people found this helpful","Great deal","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13PAEA4VIDEO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2020","5705","865","Style: R3 3200U"

A creative whim to see if OpenToonz is as great as two hundred Youtubers swear it is.I was worried that it might not be able to handle such complex programs, since it is in fact a budget laptop, but I was pleasantly surprised. Not only does it effectively run OpenToonz, it also handles rendering in Blender and other programs that I thought might be too much for its processing capacity. I've played a few high resolution games on it without any issues, as well.I saw another review from a wonderful human being who knows a lot more about computers than me, and he left in depth instructions on how to turn off S Mode as well as how to upgrade your computer with a couple additional parts to expand its memory and processing. I did not utilize any of those recommendations (yet) and the laptop works amazing!It's got super fast internet, downloads everything quickly, amazing resolution, and like I said, it can handle some pretty tough programs. Some of my friends can't run blender on their own laptops, so that speaks for itself.Still, there are two issues I've found so far.Issue 1, the most obvious:The volume on this laptop is crap. It can be sitting right in front of your face and not be loud enough for you to hear the quieter sounds in a video. This is easy to fix with a speaker, so it's not a big deal, but I'd recommend getting a speaker at the same time you get the laptop just to avoid the disappointment when movie time comes around.Issue 2:It overheats very very VERY easily. Don't set this laptop on any blankets or pillows, or anything other than a hard surface.I noticed quickly that it gets warm basically as soon as you set it down on your lap, so I've been pretty careful about that. But just earlier today, I fell asleep with it on my lap (oops) and when I woke up about an hour later, it was off. It would not turn on. The charging light was blue, meaning that it was charging properly from the cord. When I pressed the power button, however, the power light flashed blue one time very briefly but the laptop didn't even try to turn on. No fans, no clicks, nothing. I waited an hour and tried again, but it still wouldn't turn on. Needless to say, I was horrified!If this happens to you, please don't panic, it's very easy to fix.Windows laptops have this handy dandy feature where they shut themselves off if they're at risk of overheating, to prevent any damage from happening. They also prevent themselves from being turned back on, apparently, but you can fix it in three easy steps.1: Unplug your computer from the power cord.2: Flip the computer over, and use a needle to press and hold the battery reset button located on the bottom for 5 seconds.3: Wait ten full minutes, plug in your computer, and turn it on.Mine booted up instantly when I did that, and I was deeply grateful for the feature that saved my laptop from my own relentless stupidity.With that said, this is a fantastic laptop and it works great, but there are two purchases you should make right off the bat: buy a speaker/headphones, and buy a cooling pad. I also highly recommend buying a mouse; the track pad isn't bad or anything- mine works as well as any track pad I've ever used- but computers are always better with a mouse ;DIf you're considering this laptop, I'd say go for it. Just make sure that if you're buying it for a kid or anyone who has a habit of laying in bed with the laptop in their lap, you get them a cooling pad. Windows will probably prevent it from being damaged from overheating, but you can spare them the panic of a laptop that won't turn on and the struggle of finding a needle that fits the reset hole.Happy browsing, everyone!",,,,,,,,"28 people found this helpful","Bang for your Buck... but two minor issues","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FPAEZHX4O6MI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2021","27708","3503","Style: R3 3200U"

I nabbed the cheapest config for about $380 and spent $30 on a second 4gb memory stick. Just that is enough to make this value laptop better than most of the desktops in the office.I got this for work, and for D&D so I take it back and forth with me to and from work every day. It's not the slimmest or lightest laptop on the market, but it fits well in my bag and isn't a burden to carry about on the regular (though I'm a 90s kid, I grew up carrying a massive backpack loaded with 80lbs of massive textbooks and trapper keepers, this is nothing).I upgraded it to 8gb ram but I may actually upgrade again and swap the 4s out for 2 8s because it does struggle a little bit with my work load. I'm an estimator, so I need to have open several things at once including semi-graphic intensive programs for viewing/marking up very large architectural plans, google chrome in various tabs to search for the prices of things and access our office's project management site, and I'm constantly copying/moving/uploading/downloading large files. Outlook, calculator, note programs, etc.When opening programs I watch the CPU and Memory spike to 60-80%, but the CPU will eventually drop back down to lower % while the memory stays up in the 75-80% range. Sometimes when opening new programs the CPU spikes to 100% and that may be causing the slight lag I get, or when swapping between all these programs. Right now I have 7 programs open while I type this, and my CPU is at 8% and my Memory is at 74% so I think upgrading again, as well as eventually getting a larger drive will fix any such issues. But that is just me and my work load. 90% of the time it runs just fine.It's quiet, it does not get very hot, and rarely do I even hear the fans.It was extremely easy to unscrew and open the back and upgrade the ram. While in there I saw where to upgrade the drive so that will be easy too. So getting this for such a low price, making those two relatively inexpensive customizations, and you've got a better machine than most selling for twice as much.I love the keyboard. I am not one of those people who are obsessed with the clickety of a mechanical keyboard. I actually prefer this chicklet style and I like a bit more squish to my keys. I don't like to make a lot of noise when I type.A few other things I love - the keys are backlit when typing but shut off after a bit of inactivity. That's nice, especially if running it on battery. The screen is really nice and the colors are great as other reviews have said. I have a mouse plugged in so I don't often use the track pad but it works well and I like the size and placement of it.Now on to a couple of cons.First - the sleep key on the keyboard. It's probably a me issue and not really the laptops fault, but I am constantly accidently hitting this thing when I go to hit the 1 button instead. Constantly putting my laptop to sleep.Second - I love that it has a keypad, especially as I am crunching numbers all day. But I don't like the configuruation. I find it a little difficult to use and months in I still haven't quite gotten used to it. The numbers are fine but I often hit + when I mean to hit * or hit - when I need / and its just a minor frustration.All in all this is an amazing laptop, and can't be beat for this price. If you're on the fence, looking at other options at around this price range - stop looking and get this one. You won't regret it. I've suggested it to two coworkers and a friend and all 3 have gotten it and love it.",,,,,,,,"8 people found this helpful","Fantastic Laptop for the price - Easily Upgradeable.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HG21INYNVT51/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2021","27708","3503","Style: R3 3200U"

Other people suggested buying some additional RAM, and being spoiled w/ 32GB of it on my desktop, I definitely agreed, so I ordered an additional 4GB more (A-Tech 4GB RAM for Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop A515-43 | DDR4 2666MHz SODIMM PC4-21300 260-Pin CL19 1.2V Non-ECC Unbuffered Memory Upgrade Module) for $40 USD.I also believe more storage is essential. The Acer Aspire 5 comes with a slot for an additional SSD drive to supplement the 128GB drive, but here's where you have to carefully consider your options. You must look at sequential read and write speeds, where faster is always better. You also have to consider that you will likely have your operating system on the main (C:) drive.If I were to use the supplemental SSD slot, I would have to go with a SATA III type storage (looks like a very small, thin book). If I want much better speed for the price, I'll want to replace the 128GB ""C:"" drive with the same type (PCIe Gen3 8 Gb/s, looks more like a RAM stick). I went with the 1TB Crucial P5 (1TB 3D NAND NVMe Internal SSD, up to 3400MB/s - CT1000P5SSD8) for $120 USD. It's a pain to switch it out, because you have to make an 'image' (i.e. copy) of your C drive on some other storage device, then put that image onto the new SSD drive, but in the long run, it's worth it because you're coming out of the gate with much more storage and very likely (couldn't find specs on the Aspire hard drive) a much faster hard drive.So, $525 ( = $365 + $40 + $120) and you get:CPU 3.52 GHz8GB RAM1TB hard drive with up to 3400MB/s read speed and up to 3000MB/s write speed15 inch monitorunder 4lb SLIM laptopANDWindows 10.I call that an incredible deal.Now, I've read the comments about Windows 10 S. The myth is that you get locked into a system where you can only buy and install Microsoft software unless you want to shell out... man, what was it? Oh yeah, a trillion dollars. Well, turns out that's:FALSE!In fact, all you have to do is sign into your free Microsoft account, push a button and 'boom', you're off of Windows 10S and on Windows 10. No charge, no hassle, no anything. In fact, the laptop asks if you want to do this on setup, but either way, the instructions are easy to find with a Google search. Whoever wrote these other reviews apparently aren't familiar with Google searches. I can only wish them luck on their new journey to 'the internet' and beyond. I have no idea how they were able to buy this laptop or write a review.Regardless...It's true that you don't get Windows 10 Pro and have to shell out a few bucks for it ($99 at the time I'm posting, 10 March 2021), but most people don't need it unless they want to use MS OneDrive cloud storage (monthly subscription) or remote desktop. I use Google cloud (free) for some things and never log onto my laptop from another computer (i.e. remote desktop): I just take the laptop with me when I need it. Either way, Windows 10 comes free with this machine, you just have to switch it at the MS store, and that takes less than a minute.All that said, this laptop is just awesome.

I consider myself an ""advanced basic"" user as I don't work in tech but I've built a couple of rigs and usually upgrade and replace components in my own PCs.  Anyhow, bought this with the intention of making the following changes (so my review is based on the laptop in this configuration): swap S-mode for regular Windows 10 (free and easy but irreversible), install an additional 4 gigs of RAM for a total of 8 installed, tweak settings as mentioned before.Almost everything about this machine is amazing, and for the price I don't believe a better deal can be had.  It puts my husband's budget laptop to shame.  The SSD is quiet and smooth, the monitor display is beautiful, it can stream and handle basic tasks without any lag at all, and the ports are totally sufficient.  The keys feel excellent (plus backlighting!), the brushed aluminum case top looks very stylish, and the speakers are totally sufficient for a laptop (if you want great sound quality use headphones).  The AMD Ryzen processors are very good and this will typically outperform the slightly higher priced model with the Intel i3.  Windows 10 is Windows 10, but it's better than S-mode.  The hard drive capacity is quite small and if this were for me as a primary computer I'd want more storage space, but if this is for a child or not your primary computer it might not even be noticed.I was, and still am, super impressed, but one glaring deficiency of this laptop is the motherboard control, specifically in how it lets you see/access/change UEFI firmware settings.  Thought it was an ASUS for some reason but I'm unsure of manufacturer as it's not specified in UEFI and there's just a Chinese name on the mobo (it's not listed in windows device specs either; I'll probably have to download Speccy or some such).  Apparently it's common for laptops to have a limited UEFI/BIOS compared to PCs, but the items you can change here are basically nil.  You can disable fast boot and see/do a few things like that, but forget memory or graphics settings.  If I'd known this, I'd probably still have bought it, but I'd have planned my RAM purchase more carefully and factored in the higher cost of upgrading the machine.Windows sets aside memory for some things like paging (virtual memory, but changing this had no effect on usable RAM), other OS tasks, and for sharing with the onboard graphics card, and that combined with some default mobo settings means your installed RAM will not always be your usable RAM, as is easily seen in system settings (assuming your RAM stick is working, compatible, and installed correctly).  For instance, on this laptop I now have 5.94 gigs usable out of 8 gigs installed.  UEFI correctly shows the 8192 mb installed but won't let me tweak memory remapping or virtually anything at all, and as I've tried everything outside BIOS setting tweaking to increase the usable RAM without success, I'm basically out of luck, having paid for a good 4 gig stick to get a 2 gig upgrade.  Anyhoo, if I'd known this in advance I'd have planned to get two 8 gig sticks and may still do so at some point in the future, but it's highly irritating that this mobo will not allow settings changes to fully utilize your hardware.  I'm not trying to overclock, ffs.Hopefully this helps anyone who's looking at this laptop with plans to upgrade the memory (and possibly the HD).  All in all, I would still highly recommend it for so many reasons, just know you may be spending a bit more on RAM than you'd planned.  If you don't want to upgrade, the 4 gigs installed is totally fine for light usage and all the basic tasks.  It's a beautiful little ""budget"" laptop.",,,,,,,,"","Awesome machine with terrible UEFI options","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21Y95XOEKO3AG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2019","27708","3503","Style: R3 3200U"

My first order had a defect that I think some others are also having relating to switching out of S-Mode.  You have to go into settings to change out of S-Mode but mine had some error saying I didn't have a valid product key.  Everything ran fine in S-Mode and it's preinstalled so it must be some kind of glitch or defect with some of these Aspire 5 models.  I assume the people who could not turn off S-Mode and paid money for a new version of Windows 10 had the same or a similar issue as me.  Even Acer support could not figure out the problem.  I contacted Amazon and they allowed me to get a replacement on the way without me even having to send my laptop back first, so long as Amazon had it within 30 days.  They sent me a return label and everything, it was beautiful.  So just have Amazon replace this if you have an issue with turning off S-Mode!I wanted to mention that the most to prevent people from wasting time trying to troubleshoot with support.  But this laptop is also great especially at the price.  I upgraded the RAM to two 4 GB DDR4 for 8 gigs total and installed a 256 gig solid state drive.  Acer made adding a new SSD really easy on the this model.  You won't be able to play graphic intense games on this except maybe at the lowest settings but even then you'll probably still be getting less than 60 fps.  But the full 1080 HD screen is really nice and I didn't see many laptop around this price or less with backlit keyboards so that's a nice plus.  The trackpad on this big and I've always liked when the trackpad itself is also the button to click.  Definitely recommend this laptop and with the addition of upgraded RAM and SSD, it's a great machine.",,,,,,,,"","Great laptop, be careful of a glitch with removing Windows S-Mode!

You turn the computer over, remove several small screws and then gently but firmly pry off the bottom plate. You will see one RAM module already installed. Snap the additional one into the open slot. If connected correctly, you are done. No changes needed in BIOS.Installing a 2.5 HDD or SSD is a more difficult process that I would not recommend to folks who have not done a computer build or PC repair before. At first glance it appears that you can just plug your SATA drive in and close up the computer. This is not the case! You need to unscrew the SATA controller board -- you will notice that it isn't connected to anything! You will see a tiny ribbon cable in the same spot. You need to pick up that cable and clip the end of the ribbon marked HDD into the connector on the SATA controller board by lifting the tiny beige clip on the SATA controller and hooking the prongs of the ribbon cable's end into the slot before snapping the beige clip into place. Plug in your drive to the SATA connector and place this whole assembly onto the plastic sheeting with the SATA controller lined up next to the open connector on the motherboard that is labelled HDD0 (very small label). Take the end of the ribbon cabled marked Motherboard and plug that into the HDD0 connector on the motherboard, using the clip as before. Then you will screw the drive into the two metal rails to keep it in place, and finally screw the SATA controller board into it's new spot. Make sure nothing is wiggling or loose, make sure the ribbon cable ends are snapped in and not floating around. Then close up the laptop case. WHEW. Then you need to boot into BIOS by tapping F2 while the computer is starting. Verify that you see your drive listed in HDD0.

It was to replace a 10-year-old dell that she was complaining about being slow and having a less-than-stellar display.The first thing I did when I unpacked the laptop was to turn it over, remove the bottom panel, add another 4GB of RAM and a 500GB SSD.  I ordered these from Amazon along with the laptop. I left Windows 10 alone on the 128 GB SSD that came in the laptop, which was fine for the once or twice a year she needs Windows to update her GPS and a few other things like that.  But she wasn’t about to use Windows in her everyday life.  I installed Linux Ubuntu 18.04, IMHO the most stable and all-around dependable OS available today.  I run it on several other computers, including my own that I use for creating Web sites, among lots of other business things.The laptop now default boots into Linux, but if she wants to use Windows, she just needs to click on it on the momentary boot screen that pops up when booting or restarting the laptop. Linux plays well the Acer setup and connected to wifi, our two wireless printers, Bluetooth and everything else it was supposed to do without a hitch.  It works fine with the Acer display adapter, too.She’s totally happy with it for performance, the dazzlingly clear and bright display and even the built-in speakers (although she usually uses earbuds). Web pages snap into view instantly now, something that wasn't happening with her old laptop.Anyway, for the price plus less than $100 for the 500GB SSD and the 4GM RAM upgrade, she has a laptop that cost about half what others with its capability and performance would have cost.And also, it’s thin and very light to pack around.  Can’t speak to battery life because it’s plugged in most of the time.  Not to worry, though, since the battery is replaceable if and when she ever gets to that point.We’re happy!",,,,,,,,"3 people found this helpful","Great value here!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCWPVC6APOY2J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2020","27708","3503","Style: R3 3200U"

Even without a fan on, it's still as if the characters in the shows are whispering.- I was using Shutterfly to make a collage of photos and it took almost an hour to upload about 15 photos to their site. So, I just ordered the 16 GB RAM module to help. According to other reviews, this should take care of the problem.- I didn't think I could game on it, but I just started playing Star Wars: The Old Republic and it's actually doing just fine loading up and great during gameplay. We have a theory about this though... it's probably because the game is almost 10 years old. It's unclear if this laptop would have issues with newer games.- I do love the backlit keyboard.- Overall it's a good machine for it's price and I would recommend it.

There's an extra slot for the ram, and an empty HDD bay, so the upgrade was very straightforward.The screen quality is very nice, although the brightness levels leave a bit to be desired. It always feels a bit too dark in bright conditions at max brightness, and always feels a bit too bright in the dark at its lowest setting. That's forgivable, though, at this price.When it comes to gaming, you'll want a laptop with a discreet GPU. I tried running Destiny 2 at lowest settings, and only got 20-30fps at the peak with load fps dipping to 5-10. That's basically unplayable.

I use it to code and run Mathematica for my math major, and can turn around and run word, ppt, and excel for my business major. The existence of an HDMI port makes giving presentations easy and dongle-free.Overall, I'm very impressed with this laptop.

I also use it for Zoom meetings. For me, the cons of this laptop are the audio quality and video transmission quality. (I'm not sure I'm saying that right.) I have trouble hearing people on Zoom meetings and I have the volume all the way up. Also, I purchased an external camera because the laptop camera constantly wants to change the lighting.

For someone that runs a few light to medium programs, photo/video editing, streaming, school work, etc., this computer has what it takes. Tried Macbooks, which are great, but 2 to 3 times the price of this Acer. Our criteria was we wanted LED backlit HD screen, backlit keyboard, aluminum shell/case, attractive, full Qwerty keyboard with numeric keypad, good battery life, fingerprint reader, ample ports with HDMI, light weight, slim bezel,  and fast. Lastly, it had to be within a budget of under $600. This Acer meets all we wanted. There's nothing wrong with conventional HDD if you know how to take care of your machine. By that I mean, KEEP IT CLEANED! Acer, in its infinite wisdom, pre-installed a utility called ACER CARE CENTER. In this single utility you can defrag, clean out the junk, clean the disk, check health of battery, hard drive, etc. Use it! Some have complained their Acer is slow. Have you cleaned it? Expect to spend the first 3 or 4 hours just getting all the Windows 10 updates installed. After just that, I ran the Acer Care utility to find the hard drive was 28% fragmented, and disk needed to be cleaned. So, defragged and cleaned, then went on to add our many programs. When all done with everything, defragged and cleaned again. It boots up in 15 seconds. Battery life on any laptop is dependent upon the programs and use. Don't expect 10 hours. 5 to 7 hours of word processing, surfing, video/photo editing, and some streaming. Even at current sale price of $349 it's still worth it.

I immediately upgraded the RAM to 32gb (for the occasional use of Sony Vegas Movie Studio) and installed Linux Mint. (This is the first computer I've owned where I have only run Linux :)))  Even though I've had Linux installed for many years on various computers, I still mainly used Windows, till 2 years ago)The only thing I didn't like right out of the box is the placement of the mouse/touchpad.  I guess it's a new thing in recent years to center the touchpad under the letters of the keyboard rather than centering it across the entire laptop (centered under both the letters & number pad). I REALLY don't like having to move my right hand farther left of center!  Doesn't feel natural. But seems that's how they all are these days.Other than that, this unit has been great for every day use & even handles Movie Studio well enough.There is only one problem, and it's major; many users have complained about it.  The screen bezel and hinge on the right side have come apart and the screen won't stay up.  I've had my techie son who repairs all things tech for us work on it & he's stumped re how to make it a permanent fix. We tried the E7000 glue, double sided tape (couple different brands) & it just doesn't stay.  It would be a shame to have to replace this so soon for something as seemingly simple as that.My last Acer Aspire laptop lasted 5 years (with a few easy replacements  at times eg keyboard, jack adapter etc) so this is way too soon for such a significant problem.

Doesn’t seem made out of plastic like a lot of the laptops I’ve had before. The light up keyboard is a lovely touch, but I will say there is only an on & off option. There are no options to adjust the brightness of it.If you’re wanting to play light games like Minecraft & Roblox, this is a wonderful option. Though I would definitely suggest adding an extra 4gb ram stick AT LEAST. That’s the only upgrade I’ve done so far to this laptop, adding the extra 4gb gives me 8gb total. Which is very nice, I run roblox no problem, but I will say even with 8gb of ram vrchat lags a bit. So if you’re wanting to play games like apex, rainbow six, or heavier games in general I’d recommending upgrading with two 8gb sticks of ram, making you have 16gbs total. If this is confusing for you I recommend watching 2 or 3 YouTube videos of how to upgrade the ram on this laptop. It’s very easy once you get the gist of it. This laptop is practically built for upgrades. Everything is easy to get to. So even the most unqualified people should be able to upgrade it after watching a few instructionals.I find it is perfect for the light gaming that I want with just the 8gbs. Though, I do plan on upgrading to 16gbs eventually. You can also add an SSD to make it even better.Now onto cons...1.) The small number and arrow pads. This may really bother some.  With me however I don’t really mind it, with most games I play there’s the option to use w, a, s & d controls. So there’s an alternative, but if you really love your arrow controls it’s definitely cramped.2.) No SD slot. If you’re a big camera person or SD card person in general this laptop does NOT have a slot for it. So you will need to invest in a adapter.3.) S mode. I recommend switching out of S mode 100% of the time, it limits a lot of things that you can do.  How to do this you go to the windows icon, press settings, click update & security, then go to activation, after that you should see where it says switch to Windows 10 Home under that it’ll say go to store, click on go to store, then a screen to switch out of S mode will pop up, press the blue “Get” button and you’re all set!I was considering getting a $800+ laptop but after getting this one I’m way better off just upgrading it. If it can run most of my games with 8gbs, I can only imagine 16gbs with an SSD added!!Again, I totally suggest this laptop, I am on it all the time. It’s perfect for my zoom meetings, binge watching, and like I said already even gaming!No regrets what so ever. :)","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ATHo7E9rL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jTp4GxZaL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Vb+BRKqRL._SY88.jpg",,,,,"20 people found this helpful","Gaming/Business/Binge Watching, You Name It!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3I5CB0XIAZM34/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2021","5705","865","Style: R3 3200U"

It’s not a gaming laptop, though you can play some very light, simple games as with almost any device. As a daily driver for any other tasks, it’s a fantastic choice.The screen is far superior to anything else you’ll find in this price range as it’s not only 1080p but the viewing angles are wide and the quality of the picture is great. The backlit keyboard is possibly the only one of its kind in this price range. It’s pretty big, and because of this they even manage to fit a small numpad into the keyboard layout which is practically unheard of when it comes to notebooks. The chassis is mostly metal (aluminum?) which is durable, more likely to dent than break, and provides some function as a heat sink. The bottom is plastic, but it’s well-ventilated.Personally, I’m more of a Linux and even Mac guy myself (I bought this for my girlfriend), but don’t let any of those other reviewers scare you away. It does start in Windows S Mode but you can just turn that off - it comes with the full version of Windows 10 Home edition with Office and all the bells and whistles. The software alone is worth over $100. And of course if you’re more like me, you can always put a Linux distro on it instead if you prefer.The downsides are obvious, but they’re also not really downsides in my opinion - 4gb of RAM and 128gb of storage. The storage is NVME M.2, though, so it’s about as good as it gets aside from capacity. As far as the storage capacity and amount of memory, it’s pretty much made to be expanded. Acer even has their own videos to show you how. RAM is cheap, and the memory standard here is pretty good. Out of the box, though, you will quickly realize that the notorious resource hog known as Windows will gobble up just about all of it - if you are doing much or have more than one window open you will notice it taking a moment to respond to your actions. Again though, this is an easy and cheap upgrade to fix. With the storage, there’s an additional 2.5” SSD bay/bracket waiting for an additional drive to be added so you can keep the stock drive as your boot drive if you like and just add an extra one for storage. In my opinion, though, most people that aren’t gaming usually aren’t going to be downloading 70gb files and the 128gb drive should be enough space.All in all, this thing is a steal. If you’re looking for a notebook for serious gaming or a lot of video editing, you’re gonna have to spend at least 3x the price of this and I’d even suggest a desktop if that works for you.

In our household, we use computers for work, internet access, email, photo and word processing, and (particularly for me) musical notation and audio playback. No games, nothing requiring huge amounts of processing power. But still, this laptop is a quantum improvement over anything--desktop or laptop--I have ever used.I bought one of these for my wife when she retired and needed her own (rather than the office-provided) computer.  I chose this Aspire mainly because it was cheap; but I have been impressed by its performance.  So much so, in fact, that I bought another for myself.The first thing I noticed is how beautiful the display looks.  I used to think my camera took crappy pictures.  Now I know it takes great pictures--it just needs a good computer display to see them at their best.The second great thing is the speed with which this boots up.  This laptop is ready to go in well under half a minute.  And it loads and runs programs fast too.S-mode would never work for us:  too many non-Microsoft proprietary programs that I need to mount--much of it open-source free-ware like Mozilla, Open Office, etc; but I also need many music creation and notation programs, like Finale and Band-In-A-Box  However, it was quite easy to take the computer out of S-mode, and I don't know why some reviewers found that modification hard.I had to buy an external CD drive, as I still need that tech for several  continuing projects.  But that did not add much to the cost, and I think not having a CD drive on a laptop is pretty much the norm now, anyway.There is room for added RAM and a second internal hard drive--which I bought, but have not felt the need to install yet after 6 months of use.My wife's computer has worked flawlessly for the last 9 months.  Bu mine has a couple of glitches, which made me reduce the rating from 5 to 4 stars.Periodically, I get an error message that my USB device (and what peripheral is not USB these days?) is not recognized.  Since I have all my USB devices on a single outlet multiplier, I can simply switch to one of the other laptop ports (there are 3), and that solves the problem, for a while.  When the message comes up again, I switch ports again. So far, so good...A second annoyance is that the audio output jack is iffy and needs wiggling from time to time to perform properly.I don't think any computer I have owned has lasted longer than 5 years  or so--usually slowly degrading until finally needing professional restoration of my data.  I suspect this Acer will last no longer and maybe not nearly as long.  But at the price, we will be quite happy to get two or three years out of these machines.",,,,,,,,"","Pretty good!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU474DA1UUYPN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2020","5705","865","Style: R3 3200U"

The screen quality is very good.  The backlit keyboard is nice.  It is also VERY light, and that is great.Cons so far (3 days):  There is no light on the keyboard to tell you when cap lock or num lock are on.  I found this to be a problem straight out of the box setting it up when I couldn't tell what were the capital letters in the password I was putting in!  Secondly, a good bit of the set up involved telling Microsoft exactly how I want them to spy on me, but not giving me any options of not being spied on.  My millenial daughter says people don't care about this any more, but I find it offensive that MS thinks they have the right to know everything I do on my computer and to put ads on it at their whim.  I only get to choose whether I want them personalized or not.  My word. It's none of their business! Thirdly, when I tried to install the program from my job that I bought this computer to use, of course it wouldn't install because of S mode.  When I told it I wanted out of S mode it told me I had to go to the MS Store and buy MS Home for $139!!  My thanks to all the other reviewers who said I could get out of S mode for free.  I finally googled it and MS's own website had the directions I needed.  Note that when I went into settings it was telling me the computer couldn't activate Windows in big red letters.  I had to respond to that first before the ""Switch out of S Mode"" prompts appeared, but I finally did manage to get out of it.So, good basic computer, but be prepared to give up your privacy and go through some minor hassle in setting it up.",,,,,,,,"37 people found this helpful","Just a Head's Up","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VSZJR87WYT3S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2019","5705","865","Style: R3 3200U"

That's fine though, because for web use and things like MS Office, it does the job. It also has a separate AMD Radeon chip for graphics.

Sure it's a little slower than more expensive models, it doesn't have a bunch of bells and whistles, and it has a cheaper, plastic feel to it.

When coding, you frequently have to move the mouse to highlight specific pieces of text to do some sort of edit in your code. Unfortunately, the mousepad on this laptop is not accurate or precise, and when trying to make fine movements with the mousepad, the mouse moves in very, very small skips instead of a smooth, consistent glide. This makes it impossible to move the mouse quickly and precisely, because when trying to execute precise movements, you have to slow down and course correct several times when you get the mouse close to where you want it to go (instead of being able to quickly move the mouse to the precise location you intend). This lack of precision is very frustrating, and makes the user experience so slow that I am going to return it. I purchase laptops for at least 2 years of consistent use, and I just don't want to endure that kind of frustration every single day as I'm trying to give all of my attention towards building a technical skill. For those who appreciate speed and accuracy with the mousepad (just like with a mac laptop if you've ever used one - nothing too crazy, just very smooth and controllable motion that follows your input perfectly), I would advise you not to get this laptop, because I think you could be very frustrated with the user experience.As a final note, this laptop also had issues running Ubuntu 18.04 - whenever I closed the lid, the laptop would suspend (this is totally expected; ""suspend"" is just means ""sleep"" for linux), but whenever I reopened the lid, the laptop would not resume (turn back on) and I would have to force shut down and restart it (every single time). I could not find a solution to this issue after scouring the internet and trying a bunch of different fixes for about 4 or 5 hours. Some linux distributions have small issues with certain laptops, so for whatever reason Ubuntu 18.04 and this laptop just did not work well together. This issue was also frustrating and made for a very diminished user experience, although I may have been able to find another distribution that would have worked with this laptop. But for both of these reasons (very much mainly the first reason, the mousepad), I am returning this laptop. Don't want to deal with an issue like that for 2 years, rather just spend a little more money.

This was my 3rd one. I wanted to like it, but it crapped out on me 14 months later.  I will be disposing of it sometime this week.I purchased Acer's previous ~$350 laptop and added an SSD for the OS and a 1 TB HD for the storage space. That worked well until the laptop hinge broke, forcing me to buy a new laptop. I thought this new version of the ~$350 Acer would work just as well as my previous one, but I was wrong. It was relatively slow from the first use, but acceptable, and further slowed in performance in the following weeks. I occasionally got periods of unresponsive clicks, nonresponsive webpages, blue screens of death, freezes requiring cold boots, and such.I figured I could tolerate all of this since all I needed was a machine to get through my graduate school work: browse the web, open multiple adobe PDF files, work on somewhat large Microsoft Office documents, and sometimes stream HD videos on YouTube/Netflix. However, this machine still struggled to process some of these applications one at a time! I made sure to keep it clean and scanned for malware/viruses regularly to make sure I didn't have bugs slowing it down. Further, it was frequently louder than HP's typical ""airplane mode,"" with the fan blowing hard to cool the laptop down even when it idled with no apps open.I tried multiple times to reinstall a clean version of Windows 10, but came across some error everytime, and Google was minimally helpful. The last time I tried it, my system got erased and I was no longer able to boot the computer.I have decided it belongs in the trash (recycling).Would give it 1 star in general, as I've only listed some of my main complaints, but give it 2 because I did think it looked nice, had a nice surface that was anti-fingerprint marking, and was physically satisfactory.

The setup took all of about 5 minutes, but was super easy to connect to my wireless printer, screen quality is nice! It's lightweight so I can easily use it around the house or take it to school. Some reviewers had issues with Windows 10 S, but I discovered that when I downloaded Chrome, a box popped up with an option to switch out of it, so I did! It was that easy. It might be super fantastic, but I don't really feel the need to experiment as I'm fine with regular Windows. I'm an older adult who has gone back to school, and this machine is perfect for what I need it for, plus price is right!  Update: After a year and a half, I'm not so impressed. There is a problem with charging it. It seems that the charger input is faulty in some way as I have to keep reinserting the charger, wiggle it, and baby it until it finally starts charging my laptop. Once it's charged, it stays charged but if heaven forbid you end up removing the charger from the input, you have to go through the process again, which should not be an issue. Also, this laptop doesn't connect well with my router. I teach on zoom and I get kicked out regularly. Another problem is that I regularly get notifications that I am not connected to the internet when I am. Also, the audio breaks up when showing videos. I troubleshooted everything- my router, my Amazon Echo that I use as a speaker for this laptop, my four-year old Dell laptop and the external speakers I have connected to it and everything works fine.

Even convinced my parents to buy two more for themselves and they don't regret purchasing. In general, this laptop is great for browsing the web, watching movies, and doing non-intensive work. Great for college students since it's relatively cheap compared to other options and is so light that you barely notice it's in your bag. I get roughly 3.5 hours on battery life and a bit more if I lower the brightness/change power settings.Initially it did struggle with multiple browser tabs and windows open, but this was resolved by upgrading the RAM from 4gb to 8gb. It also comes with space for an extra SSD drive, which I currently use to boot off with Linux Mint. It does have Windows 10 S mode, but you can disable that in the settings. Keep in mind that this is not a gaming laptop, though it can run usually run older titles on low settings with playable fps (e.g. Minecraft and League of Legends).Pros:-Quiet-Has similar aesthetics and weight to a Macbook (slap an apple sticker over the Acer logo on the front if you like..)-Good build quality, responsive keys and trackpad-Screen can unfold slightly past 180 degrees-Power cable brick is smaller than what you get on most laptops-Comes with an ethernet port-Fast boot time-Supports at least two external monitors with a docking station-Mic quality is a little too good (called a friend on Discord with this and he thought it was an ASMR mic since it was picking up everything)Cons:-There is no LED indication for CAPS lock. You can probably enable an on-screen notification when caps lock is on but it would be so much more convenient to have the light itself. This becomes annoying when you're entering in a password on a website and can't tell whether or not you are entering it in upper or lowercase.-Does not come with a Microsoft Office license so you will need to either download LibreOffice (which works decently well as an alternative) or pay for the service. If you need Word or Powerpoint I recommend going with Office 2019 which was the last version of Office that works with a one-time payment instead of a subscription service-Does not do well with graphically-intense rendering (e.g. zoom backgrounds, video editing or heavy-duty gaming) but I can't really hold that against this specific laptop at this price",,,,,,,,"One person found this helpful","So much value for $400","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BBBCG1QU82X4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2021","27708","3503","Style: R3 3200U"

I did because I did not want to be limited to only dealing with MS.Everything was flawless for the first two weeks or so.  Then a Windows 10 update came in and it all went downhill very quickly.  I won't bore you with all the specific details but it got to the point where the machine would not even boot.  I want to emphasize that these problems were software NOT hardware related.  The machine itself was great.Long story short, I contacted Acer and they gave me a no hassle return process.  I just sent if back yesterday for them to repair/replace/whatever.  Good thing I do not need it right away.I learned through all the repair efforts that switching from 10s to regular home puts it in the 32 bit version of 10 and when 64 bit updates come in, problems can ensue and it seems to be the case for me.  If it comes back with the 10s version, I will probably wipe the drive and install a fresh 64 bit version of Windows 10 and wait until Gates and company can create some new version of pain to inflict upon us.Bottom line - great machine that is saddled with ill-prepared software from a company that should do better.",,,,,,,,"10 people found this helpful","Worked Great Until Windows updated","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4DQXYBK3XKT4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2020","1576","406","Style: R3 3200U"

I need to Blu-tooth an external speaker just so I don't have to bring my ears to w/in 8"" just to hear.  Of course, it doesn't help that Acer put the speakers on the bottom, yes, the bottom of the unit. It's a shame that Acer did so much right for the price, only to mess up on a incredibly low volume!  Would it have really been that more expensive for them to make the sound louder at 100%?

Looking to low end game.Pros:Got it at a great price on Prime Day.Great looking screen for the price.Very thin and lightweight no noticeable difference from my chromebook.Decent computer that upgrades well. Add some ram and it does some decent low end gaming.The NVMe SSD is very quick many of the low end laptops don't have this yet.2 ram slots for dual channel many low ends only have 1.Cons:Ram runs at 2400 not 2666 don't believe the Acer reps here I have tested it myself with multiple sticks including the one that came with the laptop.Needs more ram for what I needed. If you just want to browse the internet and watch streams its ok.Keyboard back lighting looks bad some keys are much brighter then others I bothers me.No easy way to get to the ram battery or drives.Small SSD but I get what I pay forMy goals are to be able to play some Classic World of Warcraft. Not raiding but auction house professions and a easy quest or two during down time at work. I must also be able to tab out quickly to my work spreadsheets and pricing sites.I know for sure the amount of ram would not do for what I wanted and would need to be upgraded and I had included this into my pricing thoughts. I went with 16gb ddr4 2666 cl15 for about $73. A little overkill but 8gb would be pushing it with all my work stuff needing to be open and ready at anytime and 2gb being reserved for graphics.  Being a Ryzen and integrated graphics it gets good use of the higher quality ram 2666 (15cl vs 18 or 19cl) so I splurged a extra $10 for. stock ram included was listed at 19cl for anyone that cares.I know classic wow is not a intense game but its really hard to find out how bad a laptop you can get and have it run bare minimum settings.I was looking at the E5-576G-5762 for about $599 and I would still want to up the ram in that but looking to save some money on a laptop I would only use twice a week really I decided to give this a try after much research.So for Team Fight Tactics I am getting 60 to 100 fps late game full teams can bring it down but its stays over 90 for the most part.Classic WoW I am currently playing with 1080p settings 3 (the classic like setting) getting from 60 to 120 fps while I can't test a raid yet I have only been able to use this for the stress test. moving up to settings 4 lowers the fps to 40 to 70 range.I am currently at 80% used of the SSD with only wow, classic wow, league of legends and a benchmark app installed. I would probably install a few more games just to test out but no space for now. Guess that will need upgraded at some point but honestly other then discord I don't plan to have anything else on here. Having a NVMe SSD even if it is small is still amazing for booting and main use stuff.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71trcMgRAfL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,"23 people found this helpful","Cheap laptop for Classic World of Warcraft and Team Fight Tactics.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O1SIBLNZTHBU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2019","27708","3503","Style: R3 3200U"

That is the message you get, there isn't a product key. The little paper you get on the top of the laptop says that if you have issues to contact Acer directly before calling amazon but i wouldn't waste your time. They told me that i could wait a week so they can verify my purchase although i had given them the serial number off of the laptop or i could call amazon and get a replacement. After getting off of the phone with Acer I called amazon, that wasn't that much better. I did get a replacement however I was charged another $377 or something for a new laptop until i returned the other one. the third laptop was purchased on her account, this is where the second laptop without an operating system came from. Before my wife's laptop arrived it wasn't shipped out until about 4 days after purchasing it. she called before they shipped it out and asked why she hadn't gotten an email about it shipping and they said they had a lot of orders which is believable. about a day or two later she got an email stating it shipped but we never received it so about a week went by and she called again. they told her that it had gotten lost in the mail and they were shipping a new one. Five days later a here it is, a laptop without an operating system. So of course the wife calls for the third time and they said that they will arrange that UPS comes out and picks up the package BUT they can not ship her a new one because they are coming from a different vendor now? I'm assuming its because when we purchased them they were $364 and now they are $385 so amazon doesn't want to eat the extra cost. This is the third order amazon has messed up for us in 2 months so we are just going to start paying a little extra at local businesses.As for the laptop, I think it's a good laptop for anyone that needs a better than budget laptop for a budget price. If you leave all the programs on it like microsoft edge instead of google chrome it runs great. it can multi function well. its a little sluggish if you are used to fast computers at work or something then you use this for home browsing, you will definitely notice the difference. I would tell someone that this is a good product if you don't run into the same issues i did. It's just not worth my time to have to call them and ship items back since the 3rd laptop is the second one I am sending back and not even getting a replacement.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91-tFcNAFFL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,"One person found this helpful","Didn't come with an operating system, not once, but twice.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNY013RYEBFP0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021","1576","406","Style: R3 3200U"

We as humans can distinguish colors from a pretty young age, so when I saw the orange coloring of everything that was supposed to be red, I figured I might've gotten a dud, a bad apple if you will. Then when I received the replacement, I was shocked to see this brand new ""ISP"" display still had the same color inaccuracy the first one had. Now my previous computer was the Acer Aspire E15, the predecessor to this descendent of the new Aspire series. I compared the two to see If I was really being that picky in terms of color sensitivity, and the results were shocking. Not only does this display have a hard time correctly showing red, but it lacked the ability to show the vibrancy of green, purple, and even pink. Now those are colors that didn't automatically come to my attention, but it was interesting to know the amount of dullness these screens have in comparison to older budget models. Now for those that argue that this is a budget computer, the computer's ability to display color accuracy (Standard colors like BLUE, RED, and GREEN) is something that should at least be set for the general QUALITY of the display. My previous computer, also a budget laptop and an Acer Aspire (see above) had substantial vibrancy in the RGB output. The colors are saturated and the best part is I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. For those that want to test the color accuracy of their screens (correctly) Find a Windows 10 computer or any monitor..pull up ""Choose your accent color"" scroll down and see the color pallet and ""Custom Colors""...compare those colors to the ones on this laptop, or plug an HDMI cable to another monitor or TV, if the color or the reds are Orange in comparison to what is on your monitor or laptop, you'll know my struggle. Again this is not an issue of colors being a different shade (reds being lighter or darker) this is the inability for the correct color to show up entirely. Now if you're not color sensitive, like I am, and don't expect this ""IPS"" screen to have color accuracy like I did, then this laptop is the perfect machine for you! Functionality wise, I do see the necessary need for the RAM upgrade if needed for anything other than streaming 1080P videos on Youtube. It can be an excellent tool for school, or work (other Photography or media use).  A quick note for Acer: Downgrading elements for functionality and available features are necessary for ""budget"" laptops, but you've taken an ""ISP"" feature and provided an sRGB output and color accuracy that is no better than an Aliexpress laptop! What good is the ISP definition if the colors don't correctly display? ....Also there are no CAP LOCK/NUM LOCK notifications, but turn on the Sticky keys sounds and you'll be fine.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617wktQGAiL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61cPWhw3b7L._SY88.jpg",,,,,,"","Great computer for the Color Blind.....","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KQKPOOABLC65/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2020","1576","406","Style: R3 3200U"

Wiped the storage and installed Linux. All was well with the world. When holiday time came six months later to get a laptop for a family member I seem to recall Amazon pointing me to this model as the newer version. I had to spend the better part of a day getting the Windows 10 rolled out, saying 'no' to its various information and identity harvesting options. Then I had to disable 'S Mode', a Microsoft ""security"" implementation which prevents you from installing any non-Microsoft browser or search engine. Or any other software that didn't funnel through the Microsoft Store monopoly.With everyone was working and schooling from home due to covid, a shared laptop was problematic so I just did a repeat order of this affordable model, the Aspire 5. I was already aware that storage was in short supply, with only a 128 GB SSD in place (about enough to hold Windows, Office, and breathing room).And unlike the Aspire E 15, this model didn't include an optical drive (spun by marketers as ""it's a benefit, it's super slim!""). But since my wife uses more storage than the kid, I figured her Christmas gifts would include both this laptop and a large SD card to compensate for the shortcomings of this model. This was when we discovered that this model includes no SD card slot. Instant buyer's remorse.I'd already planned on spending a bit more to replace the internal SSD with a 512 GB or 1 TB to prevent the problems that come from installs defaulting to a barely existent C: drive, leaving 0 MB of space on your system drive.Already knowing what her gift was going to be, my wife bought an external DVD drive for around $20 to compensate for what this model doesn't have. And external storage, since this has no internal hard drive for user storage. But having to add on an external SD card reader as well to manage photos from her camera is, as they say, just a bridge too far. Having to compensate by adding all these components after market is turning this thing into a Frankenstein.I like Acer. Unlike the HP laptops I've had, this model and the 15 don't have issues with overheating. As performance goes, this is fine for typical home use but as you would expect, this would not be appropriate for gamers. With the limited number of USB ports, and components no longer included that need to be added on, you could probably expect also to have to buy a USB hub if you ever anticipate using an external keyboard or mouse. But your best bet is probably to just spend a little more and get a different model.",,,,,,,,"2 people found this helpful","Okay. 3.5 stars.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZAGFL0I5XMAH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2020","1576","406","Style: R3 3200U"

Well, lesson learned: Don't cheap out when buying something so important that will be with you for years to come.While this laptop isn't too bad per say, there are just too many little nuisances that make it annoying to use. The main problem is the laptop's lack of precision. Certain keys don't register unless your really press them, and the trackpad is temperamental. Often times I'll click the trackpad and it will register a right click for no real reason. I can only assume my fingertips are wide and trick it into thinking I hit the pad with two fingers, which equals a right click. (Note: I don't have fat fingers, I'm just a big guy (6'1"").) When opening a new tab on the browser it will more often than not seamlessly drag the tab into new window, which is super annoying. If I'm browsing the net and not paying too close attention, the next thing I know I have four different browser windows open with multiple tabs in each one, which makes it very confusing and frustrating. Also, lately Youtube has been pausing for no reason.In sum: serviceable laptop, but far from great. If you are looking for a decent cheap computer, this will suffice. However, if you have the money, just get something more top of the line. If you do get this computer, I would recommend upgrading the memory on your own as it's easy to do and the laptop as is needs more memory, but I wouldn't bother with the RAM unless you're really going to push this thing. I upgraded the RAM and honestly couldn't see a big difference between the upgrade and the factory setting. That said I mostly use this for writing, surfing, and watching Youtube, so if you're using this to game or something, more RAM may benefit you. The conservative user probably doesn't need more RAM.",,,,,,,,"One person found this helpful","You get what you pay for....","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KK5IU5NCHJ9M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS4BP8FB","Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2022","1576","406","Style: R3 3200U"
